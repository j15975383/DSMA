The helicopters have roughly the same firepower, but they destroyed the movement. In battlefield 4, you were able to use your momentum to your advantage, it was so much more fluid and realistic. Now it's a similar experience to the helicopter in warzone, which was absolutely garbage. Feels so on rails. They limited the possible movements that you can achieve. Which was a huge part to the heli feel in BF4. \n",

Animations for vaulting etc. don't seem as well made as in previous games.\n",

The other things that bugged me is why the hell does the sniper not get a more long range scope with mil dots for some sliver of range acquisition. I mean mil dots have been on scopes since the late 60s. Why did it go back to the bf1/bf5/ww2 era scope? Lastly the flight physics felt very much like warzone especially for the little bird and the UI was trash in general.

Take each specialist’s gimmick, and classify it under one of the four classes. Ferick or whatever being medic/assault for example. Boris being support, Casper Recon, grapple dude Engineer, etc. Then, give us back our two equipment slots. Have us double tap right on the d-pad for console or something to access that second equipment slot. I hate not having my repair tool and rocket launcher both while playing an engineer role. That way we still have access to the gimmick but also our usual combination of role based equipment. Basically, if you want access to a certain specialist and their gimmick, you have to run that class they’re assigned to. I’m not saying re-lock certain guns to a class, though I personally would prefer that, but give us back our designated roles at least. The current system lacks any team play as everyone is pretty much on their own, as the specialists have no specific roles at all aside from Ferick being able to revive everyone. There’s no way of knowing who has ammo, meds, can repair, drop a tugs, etc. and this SUCKS. Battlefield has always been about team play, and while yes you CAN get good enough to lone wolf, to really do that well, you have to have truly mastered the strengths and learned to compensate the weaknesses of the class you’re running. The current system in 2042 makes everyone inherently a lone wolf. \n",

I need ammo? No problem. Headhunt an enemy support player and steal his ammo. Incoming enemy tank? Oh look a dead friendly Engineer. I’d utilize all of the dead player kits around me to my advantage which was SO rewarding. Now if there’s a tank that pulls up, no more killing a support player and taking his C4.

The others I usually pass on, Vanguard looks trash compared to Cold War where I’ll be staying. I did look at this, as my friend loves battlefield more. So I wanna take a chance, however I can’t say I liked the beta. Even as a moderate COD player. Sure it has the speed and feel…but I feel there’s games like war zone, Apex that do a lot of this with big maps for free with in game purchases. \n",

But from the one level, I can’t really say I’m throwing my money at it. I’ll wait and see after launch, just because I have friends that are hardcore Battlefield players, buying day one. I want to play in a squad with my friends, but I’m not sure if this is a rushed game by EA. The price and what’s on offer, plus buying more season passes is pretty bold for an online only game with no single player in this day and age.\n",

I never felt so cheated buying a game as I did BlackOps 4. They came out and said they decided to focus on BattleRoyal and MP. But it turned into just rushed out crap imo. I felt really suckered by that game. So very cautious of online only shooters, full price with no campaign or story mode. Easily games that can be rushed out for profit. So I’m a little skeptical, being it’s EA who does Apex as well.\n",
