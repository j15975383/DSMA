0,they did say the beta was a version from a few months ago,1
1,"No kidding, if they kept with BFV and didn’t fuck around so much with the TTK I think they would have had a much better ROI as a business. 

Instead they cut and run to the next instalment. I suspect this was a profit driven decision which feels a bit disappointing to me.",0
2,Ehhh same difference,0
3,"Board room meeting generated games are going to kill the big industries, they're shooting themselves in the feet then wondering why they're bleeding out.  
  
Not bf related but this is what is happening to Ubisoft right now. They've gone so far chasing the green that all they've been doing is launching failures from the board room that isn't turning out how they want. Deeply negative reaction and lackluster sales to their battle royale concept of Hyper Scape, negative reaction to xdefiant spitting on Tom Clancy's grave, butchering ghost recon with breakpoint then oh we gotta try royale again let's drop a royale trailer that will garnish mostly downvotes on youtube etc.  
  
They decided Am I out of touch? No, it's the gamers who are wrong!  
  
I really really hope DICE is not deciding to do the same thing. They will have a lot of work ahead of them and years of disdain to recover from if they do. Like how IW lost a lot of people with the cod downfall following Ghosts and onward, and it took a full and really good reboot of Modern Warfare (2019) to get a lot of players back. Then Activision fucked it all up with hey let's do everything short of killing servers but annoying the shit out of players into buying the new cod and warzone stuff, and suddenly they are losing players again.",0
4,Than your comment should not be made in the context of not having a Singleplayer campaign.,1
5,The game is trash,0
6,"problem with bf2042 is they are trying to copy recent  successful games like cod and apex and such

(1) gun look like made of plastic not metal ( bf1 had best look ,  )

(2) sound of guns are  feminine compared to bf1   ( not sure if it's right word ? ) ...its not heavy and loud ....nowhere close to bf1.. ..like a rubber shooting guns not metal or steel 

(3) graphic sucks ..even for beta , bf1 had best graphics

(4) feels like cod copy... motion feels cartoonish and jumpy and too fast ....like they are afraid to lose to cod ..you were / are already better you idiots  just make a bf4/bf1 hybrid and you win again

(5) too less clutter , doesnt feel like an battlefield arena ..kills the immersion

(6) jet spawning in air doesnt feels immersive

(7) way too big map . way too less chaotic action

(8) doesn't feel like army vs army head-on  war ...bf1 had this feel very good..felt like you were in real war  ....its more like "" i vs you ""  feel  NOT  "" we vs they feel """,0
7,I play 3 on a regular basis...servers are still up and everything,1
8,All Bugs aside.. This battlefield feels like a free game. Why are we paying full price for free game experience with no campaign. I only had 2 hrs recorded on steam. Also so much is going on the screen it's kinda distracting.,0
9,"Played bad company 2, bf3, 4, 1 & V. I enjoyed each but gravitated towards 3 and 4 mostly with their modern setting. Overall I really enjoyed my time with the Beta on Series X. The map size grew on me, vehicles became a bit easier to control with experience, and I really had a great time playing around with different specialists and funneling them into the classic support, medic or engineer roles (I'm a terrible sniper). Here is my feedback: 

* **Specialists**\- they need to have something above their heads on the field so you know who can heal and who can provide ammo. I'd also like to see them push players more towards playing those types of roles but its early and perhaps too early to tell with the other specialists how things will play out. I'm content waiting to see how it plays out at launch but some in the community have come up with some pretty great compromises between old roles and new specialists. 
* **Sound Design**\- This is my biggest gripe aside from technical issues. This needs to be looked at. I feel like over time the sound design in battlefield has gotten slowly worse. I still remember playing on my buddies surround sound system during the BF3 beta and hearing the rocket zoom past our heads. The sounds were there in this beta, they all just sounded flat, like they lacked the positional depth to really place where they were coming from.
* **UI/Menus**\- Terrible. Every battlefield that comes out seems to have the most cumbersome UI to deal with. This is even more worsened by the lack of comma rose (in for release) and the inability to pull up a scoreboard, larger map, or to set where your squad is going. Is there even a system in place to incentive squad play like in BF4, 1 & V? And the menus for the soldier selection and loadout were real confusing to navigate. Like patting your head and rubbing your tummy at the same time. Its going to be very difficult to explain to my father, who is coming from call of duty, how to set up his loadouts. Hopefully we see some improvement here. 
* **Technical issues**\- I had terrible issues on series X. Can't tell if it got worse as the beta went on or not (that would make sense). Rubber banding of vehicles was pretty bad but the visual glitches that would flip shadows when aiming down sights was really hard to overcome. 

Other than that there are some gameplay design decisions that I'd like to see fixed over time. Controlling secondary guns in vehicles for instance is a nightmare of bouncing around the screen. Aerial vehicle control also seems just a little off as does land based trucks that feel a bit floaty). 

All in all though I had a blast and can't wait to explore the other maps coming out.",1
10,I second this. Have an article? I had no idea that the original devs actually left (if you are correct).![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_bad_man),0
11,fuuuck yea +1 for bad company,1
12,"Did anyone else have the bug where the tall building at B wasn’t called B in the whole match and was called HQ instead? It wasn’t even listed as a capture point next to the minimap, it went A, C, D, E, F. We didn’t even know if capturing B/HQ was making any difference to the score. We wondered if we missed any significance to this being changed on some matches or it’s just a bug?",0
13,Or maybe they did,1
14,"Went in really hyped and had such a tough time playing due to bugs and poor optimization that I downloaded BF5 and am having a blast.

So... netpositive I guess.

Also as someone new to BF5, I am pleasantly surprised considering all the negativity I had heard about the game for the last few years.",1
15,I really hope that they offer more varied and “legacy” air vehicle controls.,1
16,Maybe it's meant to help you get across the huge map quicker? I don't know but I also hardly noticed the difference between tactical and regular sprint.,1
17,CoD ground wars is more Battlefield than Battlefield,0
18,This is the best summary.,1
19,"Some things that I'd like to be improved;

\-Performance was really horrible. Not acceptable so hopefully this is a ""beta"" thing. I got like \~110fps on lowest possible settings (1440p) with a 5900x with GPU usage sitting at 80ish%. I'd imagine lower end hardware would have a hard time.

\-Despite Nvidia reflex ON it felt like the mouse would ""lag"" a tad during the heaviest of combat.

\-Something is really off with mouse sensitivity. I tried replicating my BFV settings but ... i dunno.

\-With ADS FOV on the scopes felt like they had no zoom at all?

\-Very laggy (internet), lots of rubberbanding and overall despite playing with 30ms it felt more like 150ms constantly.

\-Same operators being for both teams is confusing.

\-Why are there two different sprints if there is no reason to not use the fastest one? I couldn't notice any difference between the two in terms of sprint out times and what not but then again I didnt record a video and count frames.

\-UI is really bad. At certain points it was hard to understand if an option is ""on"" or ""off"" in the menu. Subjective, but I also thought it was really ugly.

\-Animations overall felt really janky, very ""f2p-quality"". The slide just felt very off.

\-Finding ammo was a bit rough. I'd like it if at least the bigger bases/cap. points had supplies.

\-Some weirdness with operator items. Like shooting healing dart downwards is faster than holding 3 to self heal. 

\-Some areas of the map felt empty.",0
20,"Most feedback I've seen no mention of the fact that downed enemies moving is very distracting for player visibility. Which is strange, since we already went over this in bfv and dice fixed it before. Only to bring it back once again?
That and medics revive at the same speed as normal soldiers, which coupled with anyone being able to bring med boxes/revive negates the need for a dedicated medic. 
Just strange choices by dice overall is my impressions of the beta.",0
21,"Me too, and now I’m sad.",0
22,I think its more the principle of it. BF5 had a (albeit shitty) campaign and still looked better than this. And I hate bf5,0
23,Well my thing is why would I run med bag/ammo bag when I can only use it once per life? Why the heck is that even a thing it basically means you have to be strategically aware at all times when to deploy it.,0
24,"It's looking more like a COD game imo. I don't want the fast pace sprinting/bunny hopping/sliding thing like COD 2019, not in a BF game at least. 

Normal classes like in BF4 would be a lot better than specific ""specialists"" (which is basically the same as in COD but with perks) I just want to be a grunt or make my own character/s.

I love that it's a modern setting, graphics looks good.

The HUD seems like a bit too much for my taste, but I'm most likely going to play hardcore anyways like I always do in BF4.

I hope the game changes more into BF4's direction and not towards COD.",0
25,"This is exactly how I felt after a few hours play....like I was playing a Free2Play knock-off. 

It's like a different and smaller studio was handed the franchise.",0
26,"Absolutely no squad play whatsoever. I hated not being able to join a different squad too, and let's not talk about AI...

I personally hate the crossplay with console and PC. When I turned crossplay off, I wasn't getting annihilated, but then I kept getting thrown into a half-finished match.",0
27,Did a fantastic job of convincing me not to buy or expect anything of this game,0
28,"Solid review.   
The game definitely has potential, but it seems that the game is catering to outside players rather than the hardcore fanbase.   


I just miss the days of using an AC-130 in the middle of a dust storm like in BF4. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)",0
29,You are kidding right? So you are saying you havent been killed from rooftops/trees anymore since the hook? You are lying if you didn't. It completely changes everything. Rooftops doesn't require ladder climbing or vehicles anymore. It's dumb as fuck,0
30,"I had fun. Gunplay is super subjective, but I thought it was pretty good given the limited selection, and the TTK seemed fine. 

I don’t really mind the idea of the specialists. I do hope factions are distinguished from one another better at release though. It looks pretty dumb having a Mackay take down a Mackay and then get shot by another Mackay. Also they could probably tweak the availability of gadgets to bring back some of that “class” feeling, hopefully won’t be too difficult. 

The map got a bit old, but it’s just one of 12 at launch, so not worried about that. Weather effects, environmental destruction and the rocket/tornado set pieces were all very cool. I’m keen to see the other destructible environments though, I know they mentioned a fully destructible village in Hourglass. 

Pretty buggy, but all betas are. I’m excited for launch, I think it’ll be a lot of fun. Particularly excited for Portal, and interested to see Hazard Zone too.",1
31,"I played it both on the Series S and Xbox One X. While the Series S version wasn't perfect, it was stable and played pretty well. It was very noticeable that the Xbox One version needs a lot of TLC. 

If the upgraded PC falls through, getting a Series wouldn't be a bad alternative.",1
32,"It was fun, not quite the bf-feel tho.
Hated the armor system",1
33,Or... Portal is going to be another Firestorm. Could go either way at this point.,0

36,"From battlefield Bad Company 1 up until Battlefield 4, they NAILED the formula on how to create an immersive Battlefield that was engrossing and exciting. Battlefield 1 was a shift, but I understood the creativity in taking the series in a new direction. Overall, I’ve played thousands of hours on the collective Battlefield titles. And to see this now? This is absolutely terrible. I couldn’t play for more than 30 minutes, it feels like this game was released 8 years ago, being something that was competing to live up to Battlefield 4’s potential.",0
37,Are you me? Felt like I was shooting bbs. I love nothing more than being an annoying ass keeping enemies' heads down.,0
38,"I agree, definitely a lot of bugs and things that are to be sorted out. But gameplay was fun and engaging. Hope the maps are designed in a way to encourage squad/team play. Overall loved the beta, wish it were still live",1
39,"One thing I absolutely don't understand why it is in the game is this ""traversal sprint"". It could be removed and it wouldn't gameplay in any significant way.

It feels like they glanced over to Modern Warfare and copy pasted the mechanic without much thought put into it. I tried out both auto traversal sprint and then regular sprint in gameplay and I haven't noticed any difference apart from the former being faster, so there is literally no reason to use the regular sprint ever. 

Apart from this, there are so many little things that eventually worsened the experience for me considerably. 

Why do I have to redo my attachments again every match?

Why is there almost no information in the selection screen for your loadouts?

Why do we only get very generic information about attachments? 

Why does traversal sprint exist? 

Why do half my ammo boxes disappear the moment I place them?

Why is performance alright and out of nowhere shits the bed for like 5 seconds?

Why is netcode so shit?

Why can't I see my own pings?

Why is there no info about incoming medics when you're down?

What's the point of having ""ENEMY GAINED/LOST SECTOR MAJORITY"" or big fucking pop ups on the left of the screen, when this info could be easily displayed with little icon at the top of the screen and a short audio cue like in previous titles?

Why does every single ammo type have to have its own ammo count, when it makes everything complicated?

On that note, why is the ammo box so underpowered and in turn the medic bag so overpowered?

Why is reviving a team mate such a PITA? More often than not my dude picks up their weapons several times before starting to revive, since for some reason picking up kits has priority over reviving...

Why are parts of the UI unnessecarily big, while stuff like your HP is a literal 2 pixel thick bar and barely visible or team mate icons in comparison?

Why is the scoreboard such doodoo?

Why do I get kicked out of the game without notice?

What's the deal with the ATROCIOUS menu navigation? Space to invite? I can't use my mouse to do that? Several options are present multiple times in several sub menues for no reason. Settings hard to read.

Why do you release a build that is several months old with so many bugs and issues and the next day you tell us the latest build has so many improvements yet we have to deal with so many issues?

Why can't I access the map in any way apart from the selection menu?

Which is why I ask, why can’t a PS5 player jump into the 64 player lobbies that will be available for PS4 players?

\- the whole ui in general is really bad. no grenade markers, nearby medics, absolutely awful scoreboard, and the bar across the screen when objectives are taken? way too large.

\- movement is alright but feels like a straight up rip from warzone and apex legends rather than something of battlefields' own style. and prone on your back seems to have been removed since the last bf game. why

\- plus system was done better by crysis, a 14 year old game. and it isnt even that useful. how often are you *really* going to need to change things on the fly between spawns?

\- few people have pointed out that the sound design just seemed really messy. might just be on orbital. lots going on but not really much clarity to anything.

\- graphics-wise it actually seemed a step back from bfV and bf1 somehow. 

\- enemies and friendlies look exactly the same. this will be chaos in hc mode without visual distinction between teams.

Anyway, my random thoughts as a BF player since BF2.

- Loved the game. 

- Operators appearance should ideally be able to be toggled off, but if not, there needs to be a hell of a lot more of them at launch.

- Appearance of specialists need to differ on each side, honestly I can't understand why you haven't done this. 

- Destruction of buildings is not enough. That's what keeps me playing, having variety to the map every time you play. Need BF4 level destruction at least. 

- TTK and gunplay is great, perfect imo. no need to change 

- AA missiles travel too slowly. Helis turning round and out running AA missiles across the map is fucking stupid, stop this. 

Melee attacks seem awkward.",1

102,"I will not be buying this game at launch.

* The removal of classes and the addition of specialists is a poorly executed money grab that is nearly universally hated by everyone.  

* The graphics are an enormous downgrade from the last two Battlefield titles.

* The gameplay feels nothing like a Battlefield title, just a team death match on Call of Duty mashed up with some Apex legends. 

* If the one map we got to see was any indication, the maps in this game are all going to boring & uninspired. It isn't enough to say ""This Battlefield is going to have 120+ players!"" if all the maps are just going to be painfully large with vast spaces of nothing going on. 

* The entire interface and especially the scoreboard looks like something I would've cooked up in MSPaint in an hour when I was 12 years old and getting into graphic's design, it is actually embarrassing that someone both made the scoreboard and someone else said ""yeah this looks OK"" . (And the continual dumbing down of the stats we get to see each game)

I cannot overstate how disappointing this beta was. Even setting aside the ludicrous changes they've made to the core formula of the game, it feels like an unfinished mess that needs another year of development to be ready.

I might buy this when it's on sale for $20, it isn't worth a penny more than that. If it weren't for the removal of classes I would feel less critical, but it is obvious that the people in charge of development of this franchise are completely disconnected from what makes Battlefield what it is, and they're just chasing money-grubbing trends of more popular games, it is sad to see one of the game series of my childhood in this state.",0
103,BF1 and BF5 were quite far removed from BF4 remakes so what made you think this would be a remake? Think you had too high of expectations.,1
104,neither did bad company 2 of bf2. And both were slower than bf4. So whats your point? It was a great addition that should have stayed.,1
105,[刪除],0
106,Did not enjoy what i played (pc). I know the build was allegedly a 3 month old build but there was a lot of things they need to fix or change. I hope they delay the game to release it polished. I better not hear no excuse about “well BF3 and BF4 were buggy at launch so deal with it”. We need to hold these companies accountable. We are forking up 60-70 bucks for a multiplayer ONLY game. It better work on release. On another note the Specialist system is ass and motivates one man army playing instead of actual squad/team play. I know they are ditching the class system because the Specialist system is more mtx friendly(sell us skins similar to Apex).,0
107,"I’m basing this off of literally nothing but I think that’s a cop out.

110,Well I’ll tell you one thing- the WW3 devs are probably popping champagne bottles after this weekend beta. I expected their game to dissolve into nothing on 2042 launch but it’s looking like they might deliver a more BF experience than BF. Specialists and gameplay in general feels like a freemium ripoff of an actual BF game.,0
111,"They did state that the build was months old, but for all i know that is a big lie. Not saying it is and remaining hopeful that it isn't and it is buttery smooth on release, but wont be too upset if it pulls a bf4 and has a buggy release, with some patches a few months later.",0
112,"I know it’s easy to shit on bf2042 right now, but I would definitely say that this beta left a bad taste for me anyways. 

I would say that even the bfv beta looked better than this. The main issue with the bfv beta was just all the animation glitches and it had optimization problems but it looked really good from a visual standpoint. The destruction was all there, and the snow actually had to get nerfed because it was too strong. So the final version had “worse” visuals depending on if you liked how much of a snowstorm there was in the game.",0
113,"And I LOVE that!  
I would've hated if everyone would fly around with jetpacks and if every helicopter would be a fucking drone.  


I think they found a good balance between futurism and gameplay. I mean even the last DLC of BF4 had more futuristic stuff in it (railgun, hovering tanks, etc.)",1
114,"Personally, I don't think the game is ready.  Bugs were prevalent.  Performance on PS4 version was really bad during weather events or when too many players were near one another.  I strongly feel the game needs to be delayed for at least a few months.  But, since that likely won't happen, I'm just going to express that I won't be buying the game at all if released anywhere close to the state it was in during Beta.  It's not something I'd enjoy playing even if free, too many issues at the moment.",0

It’s just poorly implemented. I don’t even get why they didn’t keep the BFV setup. You have your classes but then you’ve got customisation options for appearance. Could even buy skins if you’re so inclined. Add in unlocked primary weapons and it should be fine 

Also people say how primary weapons locked to classes is stupid but that’s how it is irl too. Not every soldier has an LMG. Not every soldier has an M203 launcher. Not every soldier carries a scoped rifle. You don’t get to pick what weapon you carry whenever you want. Everyone has their role to play. BF may not be realistic but it has elements of realism in its portrayal of military and combat and I think it should stick to that because it does it well.",0

130,">If this is their best map

No one said this was their best map.

>Bad physics, bad netcode, bad hitmarkers, bad UI

some vehicle physics were really weird, what was wrong with the hitmarkers? I quite liked them. The UI when playing wasn't bad. I like them too but the top bar telling we took the objective etc was down right bad. Same with the main menu. Very big and blocky.

>So many cool features and abilities from BFV are missing, weird movement

I can agree that BFV had better movement like the climbing and out of reach animations were just abandoned on the beta.

>NO AIM ASSIST WITH CROSSPLAY?!? What are they thinking?

They are thinking about equality or do you want me to slightly turn on the aimbot?

>Specialists and no squad leaders ruin the team element. Everyone just doing their own thing, nobody is reviving or passing ammo

i agree with this one. When everybody can be their own army no one will help anyone. I revived only my squadmates because why would i play the medic role when i can already heal myself with health kit that every class can now equip.

>Graphics look BAD. Like words than BF4, which is mindboggling.

I guess you aren't playing on PS5 or PC? Because the graphics are actually pretty nice.

>DMR and Snipers are broken

DMR IS BROKEN? It's underpowered. 4 shots to mid range and 5 to 8 to long. Sniper has always been 2 shots to body and 1 for head. It's annoying how some people want the sniper to be the 1 shot killer like in CoD.

I didn't see any big bugs when playing. The elevators were little buggy like the doors wouldn't stay open but you could still walk through them also the insides of elevator seemed like there wasn't any texture on them. Got the same feeling when watching some of the vehicles. They were just plain gray.",1

It felt like I was playing Call of Duty Warzone but with more colorful graphics.

There was ZERO teamwork involved and the game honestly focused more on being a mercenary rather than a team player

So many bugs and glitches. The amount of bugs, glitches, stuttering, frame rate issues in this beta really made this game unplayable for me and really unenjoyable for others. 

Why does everyone look the same?! Who at dice thought this would be a great idea?!!

There’s little to absolutely no class customization other than the plus system

Vehicle controls are ATROCIOUS. Flying was absolutely horrible with the controls. 

No spotting? What happened to the spotting function? Apparently it’s there but it doesn’t work… like really?! 

Gunplay felt like it was ripped straight out of modern warfare 2019 and sometimes it felt very inconsistent hitting your shots. Sniping was such a huge downgrade

Optimization for pc is absolutely horrible

TL:DR: This game felt like it was a cheap copy of BF4 made by some third party Chinese company",0

I'll never understand why they feel that they have totally reinvent the wheel with each release?  Why not just take a game like BF3, BF4 or BC and then just take those bones and improve it and make it more modern, beautiful and immersive.

Imagine Operation from BF1 with Narrator along with Grand Operation from BF 5 merge.

It would make sense for 2042 since it didnt have campaign.

If we go to Operation Orbital, it will start with narrator narrating the lore of 2042, the USA have to defend the rocket while the Russia take over sector by sector to reach the rocket and destroy it. With the random chance of Tarnados destroying everything.

And the next map is part of Orbital, but I doubt we will get something like grand op from bF5, where the next match, we will start from Osprey parachutting down onto the next map with limited resources taken from previous orbital map, so normal operation from B1 is good too.",1

144,"I got Battlefield 2042 with my new computer, The beta was buggy as hell. It know its a beta but this close to launch? still this buggy?",0
145,"I had some fun playing the beta this past week, but a lot of the issues made me reconsider picking this game up at launch. I’m gonna list the pros and cons of this beta:

Pros:

-	gunplay felt fun, loved using the marksman rifle

-	the Plus system for the attachments is one of my favorite features

-	Orbital is a good map aesthetically, loved seeing the rocket ship launching or getting blown up

-	had fun doing Battlefield moments like C4ing tanks from behind and jumping off a helicopter to sneak attack a camper

-	grappling hook is good, glitchy but good

-	riding tornadoes was fun

Cons:

-	Replacing classes with specialists, it doesn’t encourage teamwork since everybody lone wolfing it in this beta. It doesn’t even incentivizes healing, resupplying ammo, spotting, etc. Never saw any teammates use those equipment. It also feels like you’re not contributing in winning the match since all you do is just dick around get kills. 

-	Medics are pretty useless since players can quickly recover health. I would prefer if the medic specialist (Falck I think?) would use her med-gun to revive teammates instead of just healing them. I don’t like that everybody has a defibrillator and it’s no longer a part of a medic’s equipment. 

-	There’s no ammo resupply spot in the map and trying to find a player who can provide an ammo pack is frustrating. With these specialists, you can’t tell who’s running a support class. 

-	Medkits, ammo boxes, and rocket launchers should be tied to specific classes and operators. 

-	It’s confusing telling which player is your teammate or enemy since everybody has the same specialist skin. I occasionally would accidentally shoot a friendly thought he would be a foe. Can’t imagine 10 Mackays vs 10 Mackays in team hardcore. Should at least have faction specific uniform colors to fix this issue.


-	The UI is atrocious and overly complicated, looks like I’m in some shady website with random popups that appear every minute. Can’t tell where the objectives are at and who is capturing them. The killfeed only lists the player’s names when you kill them; no details like damage points, XP total, and other bonuses. The spawn menu where you choose your spawn point and loadout all terrible and confusing to navigate!

-	No scoreboard, how tf did they forget that!

-	Don’t like how throwing grenades require a two button press (equipping and then throwing), you can change it in the settings but you’ll end up tossing both nades. I read from someone that it reduces nade spam but when you change it, you get even more nade spam lol. I also don’t like the grenade button is mapped to the d-pad.

-	So many glitches and visual bugs. I’m playing on the Series X and the game is flickering like a mf’er. At one point it looks seizure inducing. This game looks more like an alpha than a beta. 

-	Helicopter controls are ass, had difficulty navigating the skies with these controls.

-	Camera is jittery when on a turret.

-	Spotting is inconsistent, sometimes it can spot an enemy, sometimes it doesn’t.

-	While I like Orbital, I would prefer if the map was a bit smaller so there’s action at every corner instead a few isolated spots.

-	There’s isn’t a lot destruction to buildings compared to BFV

-	Speaking of BFV, a lot of the other features from that game aren’t available in this beta. I haven’t played a lot of BFV, but there was video of the missing features somewhere in the battlefield subreddit and it’s kinda surprising that DICE would remove them in this beta.


I was hyped to play this game at launch but after playing the beta, I’ll just wait on it and buy it during a sale. Seeing it at this state with the game coming out in a month doesn’t inspire confidence that we’ll have a good, functional Battlefield game this year. I wouldn’t mind if they delayed it for several months or so. I hoped DICE would redeem themselves after BFV, seeing those trailers for BF2042 gave me hope that they will deliver. I guess we’ll just wait and see.",0

It all started to go downhill in BFV where they decided to avoid specifically naming and contextualizing certain battles and instead made them generic WW2-type battle maps. ""Twisted Steel"", ""Devastation"", ""Operation Underground"", ""Panzerstorm"" all come to mind. Things got better with the Pacific, but you could tell that for some reason they were avoiding clear identifications and contextualizations of certain battles, almost as if they were afraid to name them. They also continued the trend of mirroring weapons for both armies for ""balance"" reasons, even though Battlefield games are so far from becoming competitive in any way.

At this point I don't think these things are oversights and I'm pretty confident that EA/Dice had an explicit conversation where they decided to make Battlefield a more generic sandbox shooter with historical ""themes"". All of this is likely a strategy to appeal to a more mainstream audience, yet they fail horribly at this with every game. That strategy isn't working, and now they've degraded the core experience, pushing the Battlefield community away as well.",0

I wish they'd up squads back to 5 at most, and maybe pump up damage from some guns. Otherwise it ran decently enough considering its a Beta, visuals where fine for me (Personally don't like the mud splatters from BFV and 1, someone in another thread complained about that).

Yes the identifying friend or foe is a bit of a pain but its not the end of the world and once people start playing barbie dress up with cosmetics characters will start to look different so its not ""5 Macky's just ran by as much. At most they need to add more icons to each squad mate in the lower left to indicate what they packed for their equipment so you can make smarter choices about what to bring.

But this is battlefield and most pubbies will just grab whatever they want to play rather then care about comp because you've grown up absolutely watching a squad go full recon because everyone just wanted to snipe.

179,"> If they won't do anything about it the teamwork will be dead

Teamwork has been dead in BF for over a decade, it's time to stop beating that dead horse while screaming that you're doing it to make sure it doesn't actually die. Ever since BC1, the franchise has been moving farther and farther away from having teamwork be necessary for winning or staying alive.

There's a reason 80% or more of the community doesn't work together and just runs from flag to flag looking to farm kills; because they're not remotely punished for doing that, in fact, the changes to the gameplay with each installment only made lone-wolfing it in BF more and more viable.

And we're never going to be able to ""course correct"" the IP back to being what it was prior to the Frostbite engine because the average player doesn't want to have to rely on their teammates to do well; they just want to be able to jump in the game, turn off their brain, and enjoy themselves. It's exactly why every tactical element of these games gets bitched about to no end until they get rebalanced to the point where a single player can counter just about anything they run into.

\-Should be able to edit guns outside of the battle, while I am fine with being able to change your attachments to suit different situations, i should be able to do that out of battle too.

However, there were things I did like:

\-I felt jets and other aircraft were much better, and i was able to control them more.

\-The airdrop system was overall a good idea, as I liked being able to call vehicles without having to die first.

\-I was kind of glad they found a way of keeping people from camping the elevators.

\-The tornadoes were really fun, and a good way of keeping a map from getting too boring or repetitive, however I wish there was more of a chance of this happening, as it only occurred once as I was playing.

Overall, I had a great time playing, and I am definitely gonna get it when it releases.",1
199,"After what happened with BFV it absolutely amazes me they could have effed this up as bad as they seems like they have. They keep taking what should be a relatively easy proven formula, BF3/4 is the model, throwing it out the window and trying to make a new one.  I don't know what's going on with this company but changes need to be made.",0
