0," Xbox one X player along with series X player complaints here. 
So first and foremost, mainly for myself, I hate to be the BFF Veteran stereotype, but they ruined aircraft. They buffed transports which I like. The helicopters have roughly the same firepower, but they destroyed the movement. In battlefield 4, you were able to use your momentum to your advantage, it was so much more fluid and realistic. Now it's a similar experience to the helicopter in warzone, which was absolutely garbage. Feels so on rails. They limited the possible movements that you can achieve. Which was a huge part to the heli feel in BF4. 
Jets are useless. They only exist to shoot down the enemy jet, they cant do anything else useful. It feels like an air-brake turns on everytime you turn. 
As for glitches: Incomplete audio (weapon sounds cut in and out and sound inconsistent, also weapon sounds were delayed after pulling the trigger) 
Immense server lag
Poorly done, slow laggy minimap
Poor and slow rendering (partially acceptable on my xbox one x bc it's old gen) 
The guns also felt very strange. Cant pin point what, but they just felt off. 
Time to kill is way too high unless you use the vector or shotgun.
I dont think the little bird should have rockets
Theres NO vehicle customization???? Or class customization??? I really hope that was a feature simply left out of the beta and not something they just didn't add. I'll be even more disappointed if I can't put ECM or more infantry oriented rockets on the attack helis. 
The gunner on the attack helis has a more limited range of motion (which is understandable as a nerf from BF4) 
The list goes on. I and many of the people I've talked to had high hopes it would have a BF4 feel, but that isnt the case. It felt more like Alex legends with the sliding and gunplay etc. Wasnt at all what I expected. 
However despite all of this, it is battlefield and I love every single one. I even loved and played the shit out of hardline and BFV.
That's all I can think of currently, I'm sure theres other issues I'm forgetting but this game needs alot more than just some ""polishing"". It needs reworks of entire features too. But, that's just my opinion. Downvote me, upvote me, I'm just stating my opinion in hope that it will go on to help fix the current state of 2042.


EDIT: This was the most fun I've had in quite awhile btw. Like I said I love battlefield no matter what.",1
1,">Yep all they had to do was just reskin BF5 with new maps , guns and vehicles

3,"I did and four out of my five friends who played it did. The fifth is considering it as well. 

I just figure the game in this state isn't worth paying full price for and, going off previous BF launches, the game will probably launch close to this state (or at least still very buggy) IMO. 

I can always pick it up for a discount post launch if, miraculously, a load of things are fixed.",1
4,Dont know about this argument because IMO every BF campaign since BF4 wasnt really worth the development.,2
5,"I really liked it was fun, the vehicles especially the transport helicopters felt great the only thing  that I don’t like to much is the specialist system i just don’t like not know what my enemy could have who knows he could be running a sniper with anti mat and rockets and my cover wouldn’t work I think an easy solution would be to do what bf4 did and lock a small amount of items to certain classes",3

I had a lot of hope for this game but I didn't enjoy a whole lot about the beta.

Still gonna hold onto hope that the full release will be good but I'll wait a week or so after release and get a good look before I buy it.

My biggest problem was how the game felt to play. It didn't feel like a battlefield game to me at all. The previous battlefield games have all had a distinct beefy feel about the mechanics of the game and this one feels very plastic compared. I know everyone is saying it but It really does feel like they've tried to make it more like CoD and one of the best things for me about Battlefield was that it was nothing like CoD.",1
9,"IMO all the idea about Classes Vs Specialists, I would love a mix between them.

For example the healing lady being a medic class and for her unique trait have the healing gun, another one have a healing field, healing drone, etc. 

That would make specialists a nice “addition” to the classes and more options to play.",3

14,"The 2042 beta was a bit of a shitshow, game honestly felt like it could use another year of love and polish. Decided to buy the BFV Definitive Edition for 5 bucks instead. Much better deal.",1

But based on my play time I can’t see it selling well or being enjoyed by the hardcore battlefield fans. The game just didn’t feel like battlefield to me. Movement was fast, specialists, vehicle handling was terrible. If I had pre ordered it I think I’d be cancelling. There’s no reason not to stick to BF4.",1
18,so does this mean we are all going to back to BF4?,2

20,I don't know of any other way. I also had to wait through the support chat to cancel pre order as well. Sorry I don't have better news,1
21,There's nothing wrong with enjoying the game but there IS something wrong with people like you who act like others cannot criticize the game because you had fun.,3
22,It's still a massive disappointment for something they will charge 70$ for and still have a battlepass.,1
23,"I honestly wonder how bad it's really going to be at launch with more specialists available and also cosmetics starting to unlock. Hopefully it helps the everyone being the same issue from the beta. 

You know for sure this is how they are discussing it in the studio.  They only had 4 specialists after all. 

I still think they need to color themes for the teams though like 100%. I think that will be one of the main things driving how long I play this game.",2
24,"I wonder if Dice are actually going to take this feedback into account and reverse the specialist system or just ignore it.

The game needs a delay until March in my opinion. At least until Christmas or it'll be a complete mess.",2
25,"I did the same with BFV (and I skipped V altogether after putting 1,000 hours into BF1), couldn’t agree with you more on the night and day difference. 

That’s a great way of putting it. Definitely felt like a free-to-play knock off from a street vendor who insisted I had to try “Bottlefield 2042,” and that it was just like other BF titles.

Edit: been playing BFV for the last two hours and it’s great!",3
26,Yeah its pretty fucking stupid how they have removed so many core features that previous BF games have had. We cant even equip 2 gadgets at the same time now or at least have the freedom to unequip the specialists gadget,1
27,Guns definitely feel weightless. Explosions have SOME weight..,2
28,"Very thorough review, thank you",3
29,">Yes the identifying friend or foe is a bit of a pain

This was a weekend Beta too, they could have left the settings like this to make sure it ran smoother, and of course any Battle Royal game in 2021 is going to have loads of character skins and customisation just wait and see. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and look forward to seeing the full thing in action, not just a single map and playstyle. The T system worked great. 

I was jumping over and back between this and Warzone so I could get a better comparison and maybe it was because of the beta being packed with players, but its was hella fun.",3

34,"I enjoyed it for the most part but it didn’t feel like classic battlefield and what has made battlefield so good. If this is the direction the franchise is going in I could get use to it but like a lot of people I like the classes.

What I liked:
- graphics
- gun play was good and there was some variety
- size of the map and number of people was impressive
- the map had a variety if you wanted to play long range or short range you could protect certain areas and stick with it.

What needs to be fixed/reworked
- revive, 90% of the time I picked up the persons gun, I couldn’t figure out the sweet spot.
- hud, there was way too much on the screen. To the point of getting in the way of combat if you were running towards a point to capture. I missed or couldn’t see the enemy.
- it was pretty common for someone on my team to engage me because there was little indication I was friendly up close. I also did this because I died thinking someone was friendly a couple times.
- lag, when snipping and looking far people could jump or vehicles especially would jump around.

What I miss:
- the classes. I’ve enjoyed the challenge of working within the confines of a class. It made you play a certain way and support the squad and team. I’ve seen a good medic turn everything around on a contested point.",2

I love that it's a modern setting, graphics looks good.

62,">Why do i get to spot a rando sniper 2km back sitting behind a bush, but i can't mark the Tank right infront of our attack chopper?

Because there is NO ""3D spotting."" The spotting of the sniper is the (broken) ""ping"" system working and showing your ""danger!"" as the actual threat. You can do the same with the ""tank"" but since tanks move, you get a ""<name> called out tank!"" notification on the kill-feed area and that's it.

If you limit spotting range and visibility to close by players only (30m-50m?), you've already fixed most of the issues with spotting. Maybe also make it like in bf5 that you have an indicator that tells you that you're spotted.

That and make 3D spotting unavailable to vehicles, only make it visible to those on the minimap.

74,"The point the person you're replying to though is that the core game of BFV was good. Add autobalance, community servers, anti-cheat, then slap the modern war setting on BFV, create remarkable maps and 2042 would be hailed as the next successor to BF4. It seems this is all DICE had to do to win people over.",3
75,"The initial impression the beta left a lot of people is that team play is de-emphasised in multiple ways. That is the kind of thing I'm talking about as a pillar of the series, I'm not focused in on specific mechanics but rather the style and feel of the gameplay. And that certainly was _not_ absent from 1 and 5.

> Gamers getting upset that it's not the exact game they had envisioned in their mind IS a bit ridiculous

Maybe some people are doing this but there are plenty of much more reasonable takes on the game. I do think it is too early to definitely say how the gameplay will end up after release and some time to tune it, but I can certainly see why many people's first impressions are that the style and feel of the core gameplay has changed. 

> Taking a binary view of ""good or bad"" when most of the bad is solvable and doesn't take away from the good IS ridiculous, too.

For a game in the desolate future, this was not futuristic.  I highly doubt anyone could place the setting accurately if they were not told when it was.

My view is that they are using ""near future"" as a way to justify design elements that are not great.  It is not really a realistic game or a fantasy game.  It is some vague future that does nothing.",1

Making BF less team play reliant is surely unpopular here, but I have to say I welcome it. I don't have a large stack anymore, we're 2-3 guys most of the time. So not having to rely on some noob to join my squad and actually be helpful is a net positive for me.",3

Also they could probably tweak the availability of gadgets to bring back some of that “class” feeling, hopefully won’t be too difficult. 

The map got a bit old, but it’s just one of 12 at launch, so not worried about that. Weather effects, environmental destruction and the rocket/tornado set pieces were all very cool. I’m keen to see the other destructible environments though, I know they mentioned a fully destructible village in Hourglass.

As far as I'm able to tell, you could theoretically have an entire team of players that don't have medpacks, ammo crates or repair tools equipped and honestly, this would be fine but only if medical and ammo supply stations (from BFV) were in this game, but they're not, so how does DICE intend to resolve the disconnect here?",2

Compare the amount of graphics customization available to what is in Battlefield 1 or Battlefield V - a lot of things are offered there that aren't offered in the 2042 Beta. There are still plenty of optimizations and features to be implemented that were not yet in the beta (remember they're also testing on consoles from 2013) and I don't think DICE would leave it such things out for the full release. 

Yes there is a good chance I can be wrong but there is no need to be hostile. I'm not sure which AAA games you're using to benchmark where you're getting 80+ FPS at 4k with max settings but I'm quite sure the 3090 is the ""high fps 4K gaming"" card.",2
96,"First of all, I have to put out the disclaimer that I have not played any BF, nor any other online shooter since the early days of BF1. I was burned out of shooters after 4 years of BF3/4 and I wanted to also play a lot of the games I was missing out. So I came into the beta with your traditional BF expectations: plenty of bugs, but the mechanics should be up to par!

Overall, while I did enjoy the beta for what it's worth, I like many others, have quite a few issues with the game:

* Specialists have been discussed long and hard on here, I can only say that under the current implementation they bring absolutely nothing positive to the game. Let the classes be the main attraction, and if you really want specialists, just allow people to have access to one unique equipment slot/gadget. And for the love of God, make the skins unique as well! Everything else should be limited to a specific class.
* I'm not a fan of the plus menu. While I understand the philosophy behind it, I don't feel it matches the same ""realistic"" vibe that BF games always had as all of a sudden my soldier can carry of this equipment. I would much prefer a few caches around the map where you can go and change your load out. The UI can stay as it is imo, although I'm not sure how they will handle a huge list of potential attachments in such a UI design.
* Movement felt much faster than BF3/BF4. Took a bit of used to, and I understand that with such huge maps the running speeds to be higher, I just feel that the characters are not as physically connected to the ground as in past titles. Animations for vaulting etc. don't seem as well made as in previous games.
* I know we only got one map, but destruction is awful! Even metro, one of the shittiest maps for destruction in BF3, had more than this. While Caspian completely pumped me up for BF3, Orbital fails to do that (I do love the map design most of the time, expect the wide open space between D and E where it's very difficult to navigate on foot given how everybody else is higher than you).
* Spotting is gone?! And replaced by a ping system that doesn't seem to work that well at that??? The number of times I instinctively spotted someone only to get nothing was driving me crazy. I'm ok with changing the way things work, but at least allow for squad incentives. Presently, I have no idea how I can tell my squad/team where potential dangers are. Also, having to aim at a player for 1-2s before they're identified as a target (and this only works within a given range from what I could tell) is rather stupid. I have to wait to ID the guy if he's in range, and hope he doesn't shoot me first?
* I guess commo rose is just not in the beta? I can't believe it won't be in the full release
* Being a gunner in tanks/LAVs/trucks was quite bad. I've never had this much stuttering in a shooter. Not sure if this was because of people being on a different system or just overall server connection issues but having a smooth feed is crucial for a gunner. This was not at the case when I was the driver.
* Vehicles felt very floaty, similar feedback of sorts to what I mentioned about the characters. It's as if the gravity/weight physics implementation is off.

To be honest, I'll wait for the game to be out a few months to see how some of these things are handled. In it's current state, I won't buy it given that I have plenty of other games to play.

103,"The gunplay for me just felt off. I was getting lit up by the M5 from hundreds of meters away while my sniper rounds could easily be avoided by bunny hopping and sliding around. The bullet velocities, damage/ttk, no spread or too much spread on some weapons, etc just made it horrible IMO. I was expecting a more BF3/bc2 mix for gunplay. The other things that bugged me is why the hell does the sniper not get a more long range scope with mil dots for some sliver of range acquisition. I mean mil dots have been on scopes since the late 60s. Why did it go back to the bf1/bf5/ww2 era scope? Lastly the flight physics felt very much like warzone especially for the little bird and the UI was trash in general. Sliding and the enhanced sprint was also cod like which I just don’t prefer in general. In general there are some cool features they added, but the core features and specialist system just had too many issues to overlook… 

(also I’ve been playing the series since 2002 so I’m sad to see how their games in general are being released in the last several years. It should not be the norm to release a shit product to a customer and then fix it after release with various updates, but that is what we are gonna keep getting if ppl continue to accept every dumb thing dice/ea does without any questioning/pushback in relation to
It.  When I mean pushback, it’s gotta be most of the community, but sadly for a lot of the younger gamers, this is the norm and they most likely won’t question anything or even know how different this game seems from older titles. Lot of ppl seem to just accept things and shit on anyone with a differing opinion and  many BF fans from the beginning can easily see the issues with the franchise over the last 8 years. The developers from previous titles have mostly left so I’m worried the next BF installment will just get worst by trying to pull aspects of every popular AAA FPS title out there and create a game with little to none of that battlefield essence we got from BF3/BC2/BF4/BF1/1942 and some of the other titles)",1
104,"- Crouch sprint, jumping and pulling up on high walls, leaning etc

Yeah leaning should be in at the least.

- Vehicle entering/leaving, changing places - on both land and air

Thank god they got rid of that

- spirit of US vs THEM - we are all mercenaries, we all look the same, we fight for nothing. This was super prominent in BF1 or BF5 , where WAR as not a choice, and SIDE of war was also not a choice for a given soldier.

Wtf? We are US Vs RU, and that's just the map we got for beta. Dice aren't clairvoyant, they can't predict a future war like they can recreate a past.

- fortification building / sand bags / mines / etc

Yeah that was a bit of a gimmick, not really worth the devtime I would say.

- general lack of nice animations - melee, resurrection, granade throws, fence hopping

Yes, the animations suck dick, but there are melee animations, they are just in 3rd person which sucks

- special in-map kits (flamer)

True, but let's wait and see, perhaps specialist kits will be in the actual release.

- points / scoreboard - this one is big

Yeah, agree 100%, wtf dice

- destruction is lowered - somewhat - you cant level buildings and all roofs are indestructible. without something like V1 rockets there is also no ooommth that can reshape battlefield

How about we remember the giant ass tornado for a second, also this was just one map, and a terrain focused one at that. Not much to level, appart from the rocket which you can blow up, and the cryo tanks, that you can blow up.

- initiative to play as a squad/team- classes/tools

Yeah, I miss the 4 Horsemen of the apocalypse

- frontlines / bottlenecks / flanking maneuvers - its team deathmatch now with random spawns everywhere. Also thanks to AIR spawns and parachutes

I agree that the spawns on the vehicle assembly building are too op, and allow to much paradrop supremecy, but again, one map, do you know how to all the other maps will play?

- infiltrations - in previous games one squad could slip and take points back, or unlock spawn points in the back of the frontline.

I've done this multiple times in 2042

- hitzones for vehicles and destroying their parts - tracks, wings etc

Don't have anything to add here

- stealth gameplay / smoke / camouflage

How about we wait for the full release too see what gadgets become available? So far we already have drones and movement sensors

- squad coordination / orders / commanders

They are borderline in already, just not implemented with squad points.

- stationary weapons that can provide zoning and defenses

Mini turret.. but yes, the map could have some as well.

- assisting roles - medic/engineer/anti-tank - its all in one now - so you dont care about team as you can do everything alone or with two people. Also everything autoheals

This point was already made with the lack of a class system.

- clear objectives for a map - choke points, sniper plains, vehicle lands, shotguns bunkers- its all blend now

I don't think you have seen them but I assure you they are there. Multiple sniper towers, plains with rocky outcropings, wooded CQC area, landing pad on top of the vehicle assembly building.

- headshot and sniper importance for snipers, no spotting xp

Headshots are in? Spotting XP is 50 XP, the same as a kill, if anything, it's op af.

- no important points for dmging vehicles (10xp always) and no assists as drivers

Driver assists will be added

- initiative to be a good leader for your squad (to earn points/for xp/for victory)

I think that's on you

- suppresion

Yes, for the love of god, bring that back, lmg's are useless, and snipers get fucked without it.

- indicators for granades, medics, etc

I like no grenade indicator, but yes, medics and Ammo carriers should be marked.

- no spawn camera

Indeed I hate the zoom in map spawn, give me a digital map with camera like bf4

- foliage is not moving when you enter/leave

Nothing to add

- scope zero-ing --==-- And more...

Scope zeroing is coming.",0

114,"Opinion of a bf3/4 vet(read my opinion knowing I haven't played bf1)

\-Gunplay

Most Similar to bf3 (except for the bullet velocity) in terms of use cases for weapons, the k30 reminds me of smgs in bf3 where the servers were so abysmal that you were dead before you could react.

bf4 made guns a little easier to use

bfv had actual lazerbeams

it is ok if you prefer bfv gunplay but I deem it too easy. I am biased to bf3/4 gunplay so 2042 felt ok - great.

I think suppresors need a nerf. even if increasing bullet drop and velocity is unrealistic, It should be needed for balancing purposes.

Snipers hit like an ant, the body shot damage is too low, and it should definitely not be outclassed by a revolver. (This point hits harder as armor exists in this game)

if they are catering to bf4/3 vets this time around then if the only attachments given to a specific gun are those within the T system, then I think that the attachments in this game are too few.

personal bias: I still want the guns to feel as my own, if I wanted a shotgun with slugs and a sniper scope, then I want to be able to do that (goes for all other weapon classes too), as impractical as putting a sniper scope on a famas is. (considering snipers can be used by any class, i don't think doing that would be OP). I also want multiple variations of the same sight (like with the k30). If I wanted an m5a3 with a cobra sight then i should be able to run the m5a3 with a cobra sight.

and please, fix grenade indicators.

\-Movement

bfv had sliding

bf4/bf3 everyone was jumping out of corners and proning in a split second.

I can see the grapple as being OP, and movement speed is actually so fast. (but overall, I don't really get people complaining so much about the movement, I can complain about the movement in the same way gunplay is too easy in bfV than in bf4)

each game will have people trying to make most out of the mechanics of the game engine, I can't imagine that when bf3 was created, the devs knew that people would be jumping out of corners.

\-Class System

Actually fucked and Identifying enemies is fucked.

always mistake teammates for enemies (personal example: [https://youtu.be/0igGenUT1DA?t=26](https://youtu.be/0igGenUT1DA?t=26)), I can't imagine that changing colors of each side would be the solution as then skins would basically not work.

if they wanted to fix this then specialists should have been faction driven, like Mackay for US and some other guy with another skin for RUS but have the same skills, but this far down the line it wouldn't be likely they would do this.

had one game where people actually know how to use their specialists, defending B1 is easy with multiple turrets on the roof but for some reason nobody thinks to do it.

grappling is very overpowered in the right hands and the cooldown is very short.

the stim gun is almost useless, who would think to heal people from afar actually when everyone is running at 22mph. only use case I could think of is a super aggressive player who would want to heal multiple times in a fight, then that would be > than a grappling hook. as it stands using mackay is 100% more useful for your team via flank routes and escaping a tight spot.

comparing to other games in the series, I think that as much as bf3/ bf4 is loved, those games could be considered broken if it wasn't for server limitations (no explosives, no famas, no c4, limited sniper slots etc). adding onto this fact, this should be what bf portal would alleviate, but most opinions formed about 2042 is comparing it to older games with admin driven servers.

\-Graphics

graphic options don't actually work as intended, low textures are still high def (this can affect systems with low vram)

game looks good for what it is, can't expect bf5 levels of fidelity when the playercount for each match is doubled and map scale is bigger, can't expect high fps when there are double the amount of vehicles than previous games. It's a lose lose situation for what the game achieves to do. That being said, if this still isn't the final performance we are expecting, (as this is said to be a months old build), then the performance is actually great, bfv I have 200 fps on average and here i have about 130. (3070 + 9700k 1080p low).

also most user.cfg command lines don't actually do anything, most likely placebo if you experience a difference (as testing fps in ever changing weather and environments would yield innaccurate results for benchmarking mostly).

and on a smaller note

\-Destruction

destruction is a bit underwhelming but meh.

\-Matchmaking

I don't know if it is just me, but battlefield V and 2042 have the lowest skill levels of players.

bf4/ bf3 had people who were absolute sweats, I personally can always get top leaderboard games in bfv, same goes for 2042 with full player lobbies. But I would be your average joe in bf4 in the middle of the leaderboard. (I guess that happens when there is no sbmm, and old games tend to have veterans who just play their game religiously)

on a positive note, ANTI CHEAT IS A GODSEND. bfV is full of hackers and is almost unplayable. even bf4 /3 has fewer hackers. Haven't encountered a hacker in 2042 during it's beta

\-Map

orbital is just too empty, I know there are limitations with making a larger map but this just feels empty. Still better than other maps in the frachise personally though

Vehicles (don't take my opinion here with as much weight cuz I play mainly infantry)

handling land vehicles is actually dirt rally levels of hard. how are we supposed to troll with jeep stuff when aiming the vehicles is hard.

grenades are actually overpowered, if people actually knew what they were doing, 2 people could take down a tank, as you would have 4 nades.

also entering a vehicle slot with a gun has delay, pls fix

haven't played air that much, had a hard time steering the jets, also the damage to and from air vehicles shouldnt be that low, you should be able to one hit rpg a heli as that took skill.

\-Additional Points

Capturing points takes too long when the respawns are too short, while being a team based game, past entries still allowed one skilled player to turn the tides of a match, now we can't do that even when we can see the devs actively push for player freedom.

I don't get how spawning works in this game as sometimes it won't let me spawn in an already captured point.

they should Reintroduce emblems

\-Conclusion

I don't think the game is as bad as people are making it out to be, but I understand the community's frustration. It definitely needs some work but that is something we are already familiar with in this franchise. Battlefield has always released in a broken state, so I can't see why people are glorifying other games as it just comes off to me as they forgot how the past games have released, and are also forgetting their reception to it (e.g [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV3xUyfYQdI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV3xUyfYQdI)).

I could rant for days about how upset i am for what they did to battlefield in this game, but in a nutshell: They took the worst aspects of mainstream shooters like cod (specialists, unrealistic gunplay, sounds, mechanics AND RIDICULOUS TTK), incorporated those things while simaltaneously removing all of the best aspects of battlefield like classes, realistic gun mechanics, sound design, tactics, sqaud play,  teamwork, playing your class role, suppression etc etc. They added what made COD annoying and removed what made battlefield...BATTLEFIELD.

The core of this game is much more promising than ""hidden gem"" and everyone's favourite entry in the series since last week BFV.

o I may be the minority here but I like the movement, but I also like cod so maybe I’m the asshole here

Things I hope get changed that I didn’t like:

o Specialist aren’t going to work for bf players, they should have different skins for the same specialist if they are going to do that, based on the team you are on (think battlefront)

o If they keep the loud outs how they are currently, they need to move gadgets. No one is going to tote ammo or Heath anymore.

I may have to admit to myself eventually that these games aren't being made for my demographic anymore. EA definitely wants the COD and Apex players and are competing for them.

162,Y'all are really downvoting this guy for liking the demo. Are we not all allowed to have different tastes?,3
163,"Biggest gripe is how specialists have been handled. I say that just because I want the game to succeed. I overall enjoyed myself!

The issue: 
Specialists just aren’t that. They each have a gimmick, but are otherwise pointless, as load-outs are what have become the norm here. It eliminates the objective of becoming specialized in a classes’ strengths and weaknesses. Also, specialists MUST be faction specific for the sake of identifying enemy soldiers. (Obviously each side have a specialist with an identical gimmick)

The solution: 
Reorganize specialists to be within the old 4 class system. (Maybe make a 5th class like in BC1 if it’s needed to sell more skins.) Take 16 specialists, divide them into 8v8 factions. Take each specialist’s gimmick, and classify it under one of the four classes. Ferick or whatever being medic/assault for example. Boris being support, Casper Recon, grapple dude Engineer, etc. Then, give us back our two equipment slots. Have us double tap right on the d-pad for console or something to access that second equipment slot. I hate not having my repair tool and rocket launcher both while playing an engineer role. That way we still have access to the gimmick but also our usual combination of role based equipment. Basically, if you want access to a certain specialist and their gimmick, you have to run that class they’re assigned to. I’m not saying re-lock certain guns to a class, though I personally would prefer that, but give us back our designated roles at least. The current system lacks any team play as everyone is pretty much on their own, as the specialists have no specific roles at all aside from Ferick being able to revive everyone. There’s no way of knowing who has ammo, meds, can repair, drop a tugs, etc. and this SUCKS. Battlefield has always been about team play, and while yes you CAN get good enough to lone wolf, to really do that well, you have to have truly mastered the strengths and learned to compensate the weaknesses of the class you’re running. The current system in 2042 makes everyone inherently a lone wolf. 

Also, pet peeve; not being able to pick up someone’s entire kit bothers me. In past BF games I’d pick up a dead recon kit on the fly to drop a tug, to then switch back to my medic setup. I need ammo? No problem. Headhunt an enemy support player and steal his ammo. Incoming enemy tank? Oh look a dead friendly Engineer. I’d utilize all of the dead player kits around me to my advantage which was SO rewarding. Now if there’s a tank that pulls up, no more killing a support player and taking his C4. Just a side note.",3

in BF4 you aim right at their head unless its got some distance and even then you aim up few cm's tops.

“No team play” has been a universal complaint over minor gameplay changes that didn’t actually change anything because a significant playerbase of shooters have always just been in it to rack up kills and pad their stats.


Here’s the truth- battlefield has always had trouble with team play. You had to force team play if you wanted it. And by that I mean, you literally had to try. This meant playing with friends, and being in clans, and joining specific servers. You could use game chat to muster up a band of apes sometimes, but it was still not common even with the SL chat and commander chat in bf2. Not in random servers anyways.

175,"The beta showed one thing: this game needs AT LEAST one more year of development. I downloaded BF1 after being disappointed by 2042 and holy s*** it plays, feels and looks sooooooo much better. BF2042 feels like CoD (not even like a good CoD).",1
176,"Definitely the latter on the ""either I'm old or new shooters suck"" question.  

Theres been a few new shooters that have been hits and all the classic shooters, which are legends of their own, are trying to take aspects of the newer games to try and chase the trend. The result is a shitty game. Battlefield has absolutely no business being a hero shooter and yet here we are.",1
177,"Exactly :) In bf1 and bfv we lost the sandbox experience that was present before, they where good games but not funny very different from bf4, this is battlefield, abd this is why I like bf2042.",3
178,"Oh, another person I can point out a finger and laugh for preordering a Battlefield game xD

Y'know how Battlefield 3, 4, Hardline, 1, Battlefront 1, Battlefront 2  and V was broken for months after launch? Yeah, maybe its time to take a lesson from the past, buddy.",1
179,"1. Fix the scaling - size of soldiers
2. Make specialists unique US or RUS
3. Make friendly or foe distinguishing",2
180,Let’s not forget Bf4 released during the ps4’s release shortage as well.,0
181,I only had fun in this game when playing the little bird and the tank and im almost always a pure infantry player,0
182,Did you play with a squad(friends)? Or solo?,0
183,UI looks like it was made by the intern on Microsoft excel a week before beta,1
184,Sounds like beta bugs that will be fixed in full release,3
185,This was something i genuinely didn't realize was even happening until I was in this thread reflecting on it. There's parts of that map I never even seen. It was so big but almost pointless to spawn anywhere other than the rocket. I don't know how dice balances that and gets players to go to other objectives but I've never seen almost two entire teams just focus on two objectives and ignore a whole map,1
186,Video games change as the market evolves. I for one wouldn’t want Battlefield to just be recycled/remastered every year.,3
187,"where was the destruction? They try to advertise destruction and shit but not a single building was able to collapse, none of the buildings I saw even the small ones around D1 and D2 were completly destroyed",1
188,"To be honest i do like a free weapon choice as well. Nonetheless i think this game needs classes, that define the gadget you can chose.",3
189,"I’m so bummed. Bad company 2 was my first and favorite shooter as a kid and then BF3 was my entire life for a while. After going sideways and slightly downhill with BF4, kind of recovering with BF1, then nosediving into the concrete with 5 I was hoping this would be the game to bring it back to the good old times. Instead they have killed my baby for good and mangled it’s body in a horrific way. 
RIP Battlefield",1
190,"Not at all, looks like a mobile game",1
191,The only way specialists work is to make more profit for EA,1
192,All gone. Like tears in the rain.,0
193,"As someone who plays just the Blackops COD games mostly, when it comes to COD. I usually just buy the Treyarch releases, and get a lot out of them. The others I usually pass on, Vanguard looks trash compared to Cold War where I’ll be staying. I did look at this, as my friend loves battlefield more. So I wanna take a chance, however I can’t say I liked the beta. Even as a moderate COD player. Sure it has the speed and feel…but I feel there’s games like war zone, Apex that do a lot of this with big maps for free with in game purchases. 

This game has no single player and is 69.99 on PS5. I was hoping for something not COD like, and a cool game honestly. But from the one level, I can’t really say I’m throwing my money at it. I’ll wait and see after launch, just because I have friends that are hardcore Battlefield players, buying day one. I want to play in a squad with my friends, but I’m not sure if this is a rushed game by EA. The price and what’s on offer, plus buying more season passes is pretty bold for an online only game with no single player in this day and age.

COD did something similar focusing on only Multiplayer, and that horrible BattleRoyal that ended up just being free at some point. I never felt so cheated buying a game as I did BlackOps 4. They came out and said they decided to focus on BattleRoyal and MP. But it turned into just rushed out crap imo. I felt really suckered by that game. So very cautious of online only shooters, full price with no campaign or story mode. Easily games that can be rushed out for profit. So I’m a little skeptical, being it’s EA who does Apex as well.",1
194,I second this,0
195,"Me too, and now I’m sad.",1
196,"I liked it but it wasn't quite bf. I hope this is just a beta problem.
- The emersion was hard due to everyone looking the same but that can be fixed easily.
- I'm sure specialists are here to stay so they need to do some balancing/adding incentive to play certain characters (medic).
- scoreboard, again not sure if this is a beta thing.
- point system hopefully will be in the full release= more incentive for support players.
- they gotta bring back micless commands and somehow bring focus back on team. Whether it be bringing back the commander mixed with point system or what, I feel this will really make this game okay with a lot of ppl. 
- destruction.... Not sure how this will play out completely. Will it be bf4 style? There is a bunch going on so I can let it slide.
- wish the plus system would switch with the grenade on the controller. 
- movement is fine in my book.
- someone mentioned crouched running. Sad to see that go. 
- hope they have legacy heli controls, plus I wish they were more responsive.
- lastly they gotta utilize the map more. I kept driving through that tunnel like... Fuck man this would be a sweet bottleneck. Or be on this open field like.. shit this would be great if there were some trenches. Maybe it's just orbital but it's just so open.. 
- also to speak to fortifications Maybe add a specialist that can build fortifications later???.

I'm sure I'm forgetting other wishlist things but honestly if they address the commands, points, and teamwork I'll be happy.",1
197,"This might be a stupid question. (I played maybe ten matches) where was the tornado? Also, I only saw the spaceship launch once.",2
198,They actually removed suppression lmao what the hell DICE?,1
199,"We don’t want to move on though. We love Battlefield. In our hearts every game should be as good as Battlefield 3 was and it’s genuinely sad to see the franchise lose its soul. 

In all likelihood, I’m switching to Hell Let Loose. Battlefield has lost me after giving me hundreds if not thousands of hours of enjoyment in games the devs actually put heart into in past years, of which this is not one. I may get the game on sale eventually just for Portal, but not until there’s more content there. Sorry DICE, it was fun.",1
