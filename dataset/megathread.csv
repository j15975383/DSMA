"It appears DICE have overlooked quite a few very basic gameplay staples even in the Beta that not even a player would overlook which is quite poor in my opinion.

- Character Readability
- Revival System
- Vehicle Controls
- Camera Shake Bug

and there's a few more basic overlooks or bugs I wouldn't expect to see this late in development."
"Why is it that every new battlefield feels like it’s trying to reinvent the wheel or it’s their first outing? You would have thought these obvious issues would have been spotted and scrubbed early in development, especially the revive button being the same as the weapon swap button."
"I mean, they've also overlooked the ability to aim which is pretty big for a fucking FPS."
Sup Nolsey
"sup'kant, just doin sum council work ya'know?"
"It's a mixed bag for me. Works decently well (for a DICE game close to release that is), even though there are a bunch of bugs to go through on dice end (rubberbanding of planes in particular, but not limited to).

Overall the UI feels like it's trying too hard, there is simply too much shit on the screen.

I am not big on the specialist system either and the revive mechanic doesn't have the kinetic feel it had in BF5 for example.

Choppers are fun to play with, granted the lockon alert system is weird (or bugged ?). I didn't really enjoy my time as a soldier though, everything feels too fast and too light. Maybe I spent too much time in tarkov.

Overall : might get it on sale later on, after patches and extra content (and community reviews). For now it's a hard pass on my end. It's decent but that's about it."
My biggest issue when playing as a soldier was bullet velocity seems way too slow and bullet tracers are exagerated and way too big.
"Exactly this, I was getting sniped at from f flag at one point while I was on the skyscraper and I could literally dodge the bullets they took like 2 seconds to arrive and I could see them the whole time lmao, I even got a few shots off on him with the m5. An assault rifle should never outperform a sniper at that range in any game."
"It's dead easy to spot people shooting from up in the air indeed, made my life as a nightbird hell of a lot easier in the storm :D"
"Infantry movement needs to significantly slower, also tac sprint needs to be limited, it should only be used ro run from cover to cover or small bursts of speed, not an unlimited superfast soldier that has no inertia making it impossible to hit if he knows how to abuse such speed wich some people was already doing."
"The worst offender is the fov change, especially when you slide. It felt ""right"" in BF5 to slide, it's totaly overdone in 2042 IMO."
UI looks like it was made by the intern on Microsoft excel a week before beta
All they had to do was give us a game that played somewhere in between BC2 and BF4 and it would have been a huge success.  It's almost as if they're trying to become more like COD which is the worst thing they could do.

"I love COD. I used to buy it every year on console.

I love BF. 

I do not however want my COD to try to be BF or my BF to try to be COD.

Here is the thing COD will never beat BF in what BF does best. and BF will never beat COD in what COD does best.

You play to you're strengths not you're weaknesses imo."
Well said
"I don't mean to be cynical, but what does COD do best? I basically only play Warzone when I'm bored with everything else. I feel like BF is just a better COD. Again, not trying to be mean."
"Generally COD is a much smoother experience in smaller maps with less players. Gunplay is usually much tighter.

BF has always been about huge wide maps lot's of players and well vehicles."
"Fair enough. I find the gunplay in the core games to be over the top to a point where it's hard to have fun often, but to each their own! Fun is fun."
[刪除]
I forgot about story! That is definitely not something Dice excels at.
"Basically everything but multiplayer since the campaigns and zombies/extra modes have always been solid, with that being said the multiplayer is still good fun in its own right however it’s just more held back in comparison to Battlefield obviously. Arcadey, fast paced, and less forgiving gunplay is what they do well, compared to Battlefields large scale, combined arms and strategic focus over tactical (which CoD tried to replicate somewhat with Ground War in MW19 and obviously wasn’t very notable)."
They could have copy/pasted BF4 with modern graphics and updated weapons and I would have bought it.
"Hell, they could have kept things the same and just added new maps and I would have bought it."
Absolutely. My expectations were low and they still did not meet them
Can't wait for the next beta test on the 19th of November
But isn't that the rele ohhhhh
'very early access'
"where was the destruction? They try to advertise destruction and shit but not a single building was able to collapse, none of the buildings I saw even the small ones around D1 and D2 were completly destroyed"
"That's what I was thinking, the most I saw was blowing certain walls off of 2 of the buildings, and even they had their framework intact. Completely underwhelming"
And the walls you could blow out made doors not work lol
I saw that rocket thing explode. Took out everyone near it.
"I don’t want Battlefield to die, so I honestly think the game should be delayed until spring for *significant* reworks to be fully implemented. This game is not currently up to Battlefield standards even compared to BFV."
Its EA we are talking about... missing the christmas sales is 100% not happening unless a thunderbolt falls and kills the CEO or something.
"And on that note, specialists are here to stay since Call of Duty is making fucking bank selling $10 skins for their operators."
"The beta build was also a 3 month old build of the game and have an extra month, DICE themselves came out and said a good number of bugs have already been fixed in the most recent build of it. 

&#x200B;

Now, if you're asking ""well, why not just use that version?"" I'll tell you why. 

&#x200B;

The beta build was built for the specific purpose of us to play to find bugs/glitches/performance issues that can only be identified on a large scale test, and the ""most recent version"" DICE is referring to, more than likely has a ton more content baked into it and they don't want data miners digging into the game and leaking stuff out."
But the problems people have with this game aren't generally bugs that get fixed naturally. People really hate the specialist thing. I doubt they left that in the beta and removed it over the last two months.
"It’s not the bugs, it’s fundamental parts of the design of the game. Specialists have to go, the movement needs an overhaul, air vehicle mechanics need tuning, squad dynamics need an overhaul, the gunplay feels cheap, I could go on. The problem with BFV was almost entirely aesthetic for most people while the gameplay was appreciated, this gameplay feels *wrong*."
"gunplay doesn't feel cheap to me, I agree specialists didn't pan out how they originally intended, just chalk that up to a bad idea, but kudos for not just doing the same thing, looking at you CoD. I didn't talk about air vehicles because I have never been an air vehicle player. 

&#x200B;

Squad dynamics is interesting, and I think has an easy fix, I think they just need to implement bonuses for doing ""squad objectives"" like a good amount of xp for doing things like repairing and healing and stuff, beyond just base xp. They could also implement some sort of unlock system for those equipments. 

It'll be interesting to see what the actual launch game is like, because from what DICE has said, the most recent build is much different and has a ton of tweaks and fixes we didn't see in the beta."
"Big no from me. It doesn't feel like a BF at all, im going to try it with EA Plus, sure as hell im not going to buy it on day one"
"EA Plus day one to try it out, if I don't like it, at least I didn't drop 60$/70$"
"That's right. Mind that i really hope that my final experience with the game will be different (better) than the beta. I want to see the maps, game modes and be able to play with my friends with crossplay parties. But im REALLY skeptical about May things, most of all Specialists and lack of team play-oriented mechanics"
"The specialist system needs to be removed. It presents far too many problems, one of those being player visibility which is something the series already struggled with and it's just that much worse in this game. The specialists and choosing of any kit you want promotes a very selfish style of gameplay, whereas at least classes almost always force you to take gadgets that are beneficial to the team in some way. Graphics are good, but everything looks kind of like plastic and too clean. TTK is weird, gunplay feels off, hit reg is very off, spawning is reaaaally bad and random feeling (lost track of the times i've spawned in front of an enemy tank), The UI is a DISASTER, scoreboard is trash, snipers hit like wet noodles, being a medic feels absolutely horrible with how reviving works. These are all issues off the top of my head. I think orbital is a fun map, maybe too much distance in between points, but overall I think it's good. But overall I think it's a very disappointing experience and a Meh game at best. If I had never played a battlefield game before, i'd probably like it more, but a lot of problems would still standout to me like enemy visibility/specialists on both sides. I wish Dice would listen to the community more so we don't get another BFV situation where it tanks and then they abandon it as that game could have been top tier. Still have hope for portal tho."
This post needs to be higher. The reasons you listed here were sadly the reasons that made me cancel the pre-order until the game comes out and reviews are made. Really sucks because I thoroughly enjoyed all of the battlefields except this one and hardline. Oh well :(
Bring back classes!!!!!
In other words #removespecialists and #bringbackclasses
"Specialists were met with resistance and doubt from the start and still they insisted on it. It limits play styles if anything, messes with distinction between factions, obviously takes out a lot of immersion and overall just does not work well."
Specialists are here to stay because that way they can sell us $10 skins like CoD does.
"Im a bit mixed, the gameplay was about what I expected but somethong felt off. And I cant quite put my finger on it.

The big thing for me was losing the class system. I feel like there is little incentive for teamwork beside caping an objective together,which you can argue is the entire point. I only saw a few ammo crates and no supply crates and barely got revived.

SPEAKING OF WHICH. I was killed by a sniper one match, and when it panned to him i saw he had an ammo crate. That is totally not gonna be exploited...

Another thing is the UI. Why can't I see how everyone in the game is doing and how many deaths I have? Just seems like a very pointless change in order to make everyone feel like a winner."
I think they've said they're already aware of the HUD/menu problems
Have heard when you hop swap your magazines in the field you get a full extra collection of Ammo. Unsure if it requires the gun to run multiple different Ammo types. Or if it's simply tied to the mags themselves
"I can't wrap my head around how DICE thinks it's ok for all players on each team to all looks like 1 of 4 (and however many will be at launch) different specialists. It makes enemy recognition, at least for me, really hard. 

There were a lot of cases where the red or blue dots over people's head to designate them as friendly or not we're just 100% not visible in the environment, which would be fine if you had some other way of recognizing an enemy. But since they aren't uniformed, and if you can't see the faint for above their head you have no way of knowing until you get shot. Maybe it was just a me issue but man did it really feel like shit. 

Also, might just be me but the TTK for some guns felt wack as hell."
TTK is a bit all over the place. Dont know if its because of No-Regs but you either need 8 bullets to kill someone or you Headshot him twice and he is down. There is no consistancy from my feeling
The problem with player models will be solved by selling you skins for $10. It’s a solution and a problem at the same time
Yeah you right
i really hope its not every one running around looking the same. in the trailer it showed lots of people looking different so maybe there is a sliver of hope that people will have a different appearance than just the specialists? i really fucking hope so.
"I hope so too, but the beta has left a bad taste in my mouth cause it's seems unlikely."
"Bring back traditional classes please. 

Battlefield V had a great character customization system. You could pick your race/gender, as well as your uniform, and then customize your gear for that specific class. Locking certain equipment behind characters, making it so anybody can use any weapon; and the lack of important of ammo and healing will be the downfall of this game."
"Diehard bf fan here. I could rant for days about how upset i am for what they did to battlefield in this game, but in a nutshell: They took the worst aspects of mainstream shooters like cod (specialists, unrealistic gunplay, sounds, mechanics AND RIDICULOUS TTK), incorporated those things while simaltaneously removing all of the best aspects of battlefield like classes, realistic gun mechanics, sound design, tactics, sqaud play,  teamwork, playing your class role, suppression etc etc. They added what made COD annoying and removed what made battlefield...BATTLEFIELD. Will just play insurgency and pray they make more games like it."
I agree with this. And I'm willing to bet that these specialist/heroes will see heavy monetization through microtransaction.
I’m so grateful for Insurgency after playing the 2042 beta. I’m not at all interested in 2042 after playing the beta and I’ll be playing Insurgency instead.
Squad is the true battlefield these days.
Is the new TTK too high or too low?
"According the the complaints I've seen, both."
"TTK is fine, just some bad weapon balance."
Feels like Battlefield is having an identity crisis. It’s trying to upgrade itself but also trying to appeal to the modern battle royal audience. Battlefield used to create mechanics not copy them.
It's really sad that this battlefield felt nothing like a battlefield at all.
"I wanted to list features that were CUT - we had them in previous BF's, we don't now:  
  
\- Crouch sprint, jumping and pulling up on high walls, leaning etc  
  
\- Vehicle entering/leaving, changing places - on both land and air  
  
\- spirit of US vs THEM - we are all mercenaries, we all look the same, we fight for nothing. This was super prominent in BF1 or BF5 , where WAR as not a choice, and SIDE of war was also not a choice for a given soldier.  
  
\- fortification building / sand bags / mines / etc  
  
\- general lack of nice animations - melee, resurrection, granade throws, fence hopping  
  
\- special in-map kits (flamer)  
  
\- points / scoreboard - this one is big  
  
\- destruction is lowered - somewhat - you cant level buildings and all roofs are indestructible. without something like V1 rockets there is also no ooommth that can reshape battlefield  
  
\- initiative to play as a squad/team- classes/tools  
  
\- frontlines / bottlenecks / flanking maneuvers - its team deathmatch now with random spawns everywhere. Also thanks to AIR spawns and parachutes

\- hitzones for vehicles and destroying their parts - tracks, wings etc  
  
\- stealth gameplay / smoke / camouflage  
  
\- squad coordination / orders / commanders  
  
\- stationary weapons that can provide zoning and defenses  
  
\- assisting roles - medic/engineer/anti-tank - its all in one now - so you dont care about team as you can do everything alone or with two people. Also everything autoheals.  
  
\- clear objectives for a map - choke points, sniper plains, vehicle lands, shotguns bunkers- its all blend now

"Squad perks, last alive in squad warning"
"Don't forget capture zones on the mini map 

Weapon inspection 

Spotting an downed friendly to let them know you're coming to revive. 

Grenade shooting and throwback 

Repairing vehicles from inside 

Fortifications 

Squad reqs 

Im sure there's more."
"Oh god the spawns are the worst in this. Being on top of the building at B? And just watching countless enemies spawn in front of you. 

Or spawning there and immediately being shot in the back. 

There was fixes for this in BF1 and BFV why is it now an issue yet again. 

So many problems seem to have been reintroduced with this game."
this comment needs to be pinned and edited as we add more to the list
Missing BFV prone system. Loved that.
Yeah if you could copy-paste the movement from BFV to BF2042 this would be a much better game
It's not that dissimilar from bf5 tbh. They took away crouch sprinting and the high mantling. If they put that back I think it'd be really close
They can't because the entire game was built around the battle royale mode.
"Literally bfv checked almost all of those things.. and was really progressive with some of its features. Seeing them just abandoned in 2042 broke my heart. I liked where bf was going with 5 (especially after its last update), but seeing what the game has turned out to be is really…. Odd?"
"No kidding, if they kept with BFV and didn’t fuck around so much with the TTK I think they would have had a much better ROI as a business. 

Instead they cut and run to the next instalment. I suspect this was a profit driven decision which feels a bit disappointing to me."
"Yep all they had to do was just reskin BF5 with new maps , guns and vehicles but guess what they did"
">Yep all they had to do was just reskin BF5 with new maps , guns and vehicles

you mean the bfV that the community wouldn't shut up about how bad it was? yeah wonder why they didn't do that"
"The BFV community never complained about movement, gunplay, or any of the core gameplay, minus planes.

We only complained about the questionable marketing, odd pay-walled BR, lack of general content for a long time, the remonetization of certain cosmetics, nearly COD like cosmetics instead of period accurate sets, and massive changes to the TTK that effectively killed the game.

The game was a good game and had a lot of things going for it. The lack of communication between the devs and players and the general tone deaf changes are what sealed its fate. The game was actually reviving when the pacific dropped, only to be killed by the TTK changes."
"It's funny, cuz I hated bf5. This feels like bf4 more than anything else and I couldn't be more happy. 

Still not sure about the kits, but overall gunplay was fun."
"people just come here to complain. Everyone has their favourite battlefield, be it 3/4 or 1 or even V lol, and when the new game isnt like their favourite people complain when it is released"
Have you read any of the thread?  The complaints and suggestions are valid criticisms.  The game is a mess.
As is tradition
"BFV was deeply flawed and its development cycle was troubled to say the least.  The cosmetics and special characters where pretty bad and made the game worse.  


But the core game was solid, which is why I kept playing it despite really not liking a lot about it.   


2042, from what I have seen so far, seems to lack that same solid core that kept me coming back like 5 did.  I guess I will just have to keep an eye on it, but I am not holding my breath."
"Every beta since the beginning of time has been this way tho, but not saying I'm not skeptical by any means. It's just funny the people complaining about it being different from bf5, when there's another crowd upset from bf1 and bf5 being different from 3 and 4."
"I understand that bfv was very unpopular, but I feel that was because of some choices that are besides the mechanics… like if bfv was reskinned to modern times and modern vehicles were added and a SMALL amount of gameplay things were changed (ttk, maybe fortifications), we would probably be talking about one of the greats instead of one of the most unpopular."
"This is it for me. If BF 5 worked like BF5 does, fortifications, best feeling medic in the series, but just didn't take place in a half assed WWII I think it woulda done better. CoD WWII came out right before and BF1 before that people didn't want another historical setting they wanted modern. But once again Call of Duty beat them to that."
"There were so many things I hated to see gone. I definitely agree with the medic feeling… even something as simple as the “swivel prone”. I can’t even do that anymore!!! Of course they fixed some stuff that bfv didn’t do so well (tank classes and pilot classes), and now allows for some crazy jet shots by getting rid of lengthy vehicle entrance cinematics. But now if a surface is a little higher than a jump, you better hope you have a grappling hook. at this point I feel I’m just whining. On the bright side. 2042 is good not great imi. Feels like two steps forward and one step back, when it could’ve been a leap."
"It was unpopular because of the crappy launch with performance issues and maps that showed they had zero focus on WW2 immersion. A lot of the features themselves were cool from the start, but didn't fully get their appreciation until the Pacific maps were released."
Switch 5 to 4 with the added mechanics of 5 and then you have a goat tier game.
"i literally just made a comment echoing this, it’s so baffling to me they went back to the drawing board when the perfect BF game almost already existed.. just needed a tune up and coat of paint

all the animations and movement in V felt so great, the prone thing where you could sit on your back, the wall climbing, the vehicle entry/exit animations, how explosions would toss you around, etc"
"Totally agree, enjoyed BF5 when I got to play it for free, but wasn’t going to put my money towards it. Notice how in 2042 no one is complaining about women and minorities being in the game? Because it makes sense for a modern shooter. In world war 2, having almost half of the players on the field be women just isn’t realistic, and then the CEO said “if you don’t like it don’t buy it” so guess what? I didn’t buy it, if they made BF5 the exact same, but modern, I would have loved it, probably would have been my favorite BF ever."
"Buggy launch and Shitty marketing. Once the pacific was announced with them going back to marketing to their core player base we all came back, of course by then it was too late."
its funny you say that because bfv was the least popular battlefiled for a while. I get people have favourites but dice dont want to make a game which a lot of people dont play
Thats because the list included pieces CUT that existed from past battlefield games….
It’s like they’re trying to fix things that don’t need to be fixed
"Yea I’m not sure why it’s so hard for these devs to comprehend…..just bring all the best BF features into the newest game with new maps/graphics and you’ll have a legit goldmine. DICE Sweden has not impressed me. People are acting like BFV was some masterpiece….it wasn’t…. they changed shit anyway when the community was adamantly against it. And they just abandoned the game after the pacific update, and that was after fucking the game up one last time for everyone. Did it have cool elements, yea of course, but the game could have been great had they really listened to people. I’m not optimistic about 2042. I got to play maybe three times and all the rest of the time I was locked out of the game due to a bug apparently. What I experienced was ok at best. Game needs a lot of work IMO. If you look at the direct comparisons between this and BF4 (which is 8/9years old) I’d rather play 4. I know BF games always have a rocky beginning, any vet knows this, but it just didn’t feel like a quality BF experience. I hope I’m wrong, but if BFV has taught me anything …..I probably won’t be."
They shit the bed so bad
"Yup, 2042 is not a Battlefield game

Feels like a new IP that’s a COD BF hybrid knockoff"
Literally not even battlefield anymore…
"> Vehicle entering/leaving, changing places - on both land and air

You were able to change seats with the Function keys, unless you were talking about animations for changing seats and entering/leaving?

> no spotting xp

I almost ragequit when I realized that they put in a whole new system for spotting, when the Q/ping system has been more than adequate for ages. Incredibly dumb design decision - it's literally redundant to have a function for spotting players only while in vehicles (?), when you already have a separate system that works and is pretty much loved."
The lack of a spotting feature was really disappointing. It's such a good communication tool
This game is the one that might kill the franchise. It didn't do anything remotely well.
">\- spirit of US vs THEM - we are all mercenaries, we all look the same, we fight for nothing. This was super prominent in BF1 or BF5 , where WAR as not a choice, and SIDE of war was also not a choice for a given soldier.

It all started to go downhill in BFV where they decided to avoid specifically naming and contextualizing certain battles and instead made them generic WW2-type battle maps. ""Twisted Steel"", ""Devastation"", ""Operation Underground"", ""Panzerstorm"" all come to mind. Things got better with the Pacific, but you could tell that for some reason they were avoiding clear identifications and contextualizations of certain battles, almost as if they were afraid to name them. They also continued the trend of mirroring weapons for both armies for ""balance"" reasons, even though Battlefield games are so far from becoming competitive in any way.

At this point I don't think these things are oversights and I'm pretty confident that EA/Dice had an explicit conversation where they decided to make Battlefield a more generic sandbox shooter with historical ""themes"". All of this is likely a strategy to appeal to a more mainstream audience, yet they fail horribly at this with every game. That strategy isn't working, and now they've degraded the core experience, pushing the Battlefield community away as well."
"> but you could tell that for some reason they were avoiding clear identifications and contextualizations of certain battles, almost as if they were afraid to name them.

That's a really weird take because all of the other maps besides your examples [explicitly name the locations they take place at](https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Maps_of_Battlefield_V). Nothing in regards to how they've portrayed battles has gone downhill. In face, due to the advancement in technology, it has only gotten better. For example, they revisited Guadalcanal for BFV but due to the fact that they could more accurately recreate specific parts of the battle, they wound up getting more specific and just portrayed the Solomon Islands. Honestly, the entirety of your post is not a good take."
Excellent breakdown. Hope they see it and add some of the main points.
"And regardless of all the missing features, the fact that DICE, a developer that made numerous FPS/Battlefield games thought dissolving classes, and making BF2042  a shitty pass at a hero shooter just... how did that get past the brainstorming phase? It's the worst decision they could've made. It *needs* to be reversed at some point - the sooner the better."
I thought the buildable fortifications in BFV was one of the coolest things.
Yeah I hope fortifications are added to the release. Seemed like such a massive effort was put into BF5 to have that feature developed. Such a waste if they don't include it.
I REALLY hope we’ve seen the last of fortifications and the special kits in Battlefield.
BFV animations made the game slower especially vehicle animations
the game isn't supposed to be like cod. Its battlefield.
shut up BF4 didnt have animation and was way faster than BFV because of it
neither did bad company 2 of bf2. And both were slower than bf4. So whats your point? It was a great addition that should have stayed.
“Shut up” — well done
"- Crouch sprint, jumping and pulling up on high walls, leaning etc

Yeah leaning should be in at the least.

- Vehicle entering/leaving, changing places - on both land and air

Thank god they got rid of that

- spirit of US vs THEM - we are all mercenaries, we all look the same, we fight for nothing. This was super prominent in BF1 or BF5 , where WAR as not a choice, and SIDE of war was also not a choice for a given soldier.

Wtf? We are US Vs RU, and that's just the map we got for beta. Dice aren't clairvoyant, they can't predict a future war like they can recreate a past.

- fortification building / sand bags / mines / etc

Yeah that was a bit of a gimmick, not really worth the devtime I would say.

- general lack of nice animations - melee, resurrection, granade throws, fence hopping

Yes, the animations suck dick, but there are melee animations, they are just in 3rd person which sucks

- special in-map kits (flamer)

True, but let's wait and see, perhaps specialist kits will be in the actual release.

- points / scoreboard - this one is big

Yeah, agree 100%, wtf dice

- destruction is lowered - somewhat - you cant level buildings and all roofs are indestructible. without something like V1 rockets there is also no ooommth that can reshape battlefield

How about we remember the giant ass tornado for a second, also this was just one map, and a terrain focused one at that. Not much to level, appart from the rocket which you can blow up, and the cryo tanks, that you can blow up.

- initiative to play as a squad/team- classes/tools

Yeah, I miss the 4 Horsemen of the apocalypse

- frontlines / bottlenecks / flanking maneuvers - its team deathmatch now with random spawns everywhere. Also thanks to AIR spawns and parachutes

I agree that the spawns on the vehicle assembly building are too op, and allow to much paradrop supremecy, but again, one map, do you know how to all the other maps will play?

- infiltrations - in previous games one squad could slip and take points back, or unlock spawn points in the back of the frontline.

I've done this multiple times in 2042

- hitzones for vehicles and destroying their parts - tracks, wings etc

Don't have anything to add here

- stealth gameplay / smoke / camouflage

How about we wait for the full release too see what gadgets become available? So far we already have drones and movement sensors

- squad coordination / orders / commanders

They are borderline in already, just not implemented with squad points.

- stationary weapons that can provide zoning and defenses

Mini turret.. but yes, the map could have some as well.

- assisting roles - medic/engineer/anti-tank - its all in one now - so you dont care about team as you can do everything alone or with two people. Also everything autoheals

This point was already made with the lack of a class system.

- clear objectives for a map - choke points, sniper plains, vehicle lands, shotguns bunkers- its all blend now

I don't think you have seen them but I assure you they are there. Multiple sniper towers, plains with rocky outcropings, wooded CQC area, landing pad on top of the vehicle assembly building.

- headshot and sniper importance for snipers, no spotting xp

Headshots are in? Spotting XP is 50 XP, the same as a kill, if anything, it's op af.

- no important points for dmging vehicles (10xp always) and no assists as drivers

Driver assists will be added

- initiative to be a good leader for your squad (to earn points/for xp/for victory)

I think that's on you

- suppresion

Yes, for the love of god, bring that back, lmg's are useless, and snipers get fucked without it.

- indicators for granades, medics, etc

I like no grenade indicator, but yes, medics and Ammo carriers should be marked.

- no spawn camera

Indeed I hate the zoom in map spawn, give me a digital map with camera like bf4

- foliage is not moving when you enter/leave

Nothing to add

- scope zero-ing --==-- And more...

Scope zeroing is coming."
"Can you elaborate on the vehicle entering and leaving and changing places? I was able to do that, and didn't notice any difference from other battlefield games. I also imagine suppression will be in the final build. 

Everything thing else though probably won't be, and that's a bummer."
In bf1 and 5 I believe there was an animation of your character getting in the vehicle. Bf4 didn't have it at all
"Ah. I can see how that would bother people, but I barely noticed it"
I always hated the animations because they took too long and sometimes I would get kill before getting in a vehicle. I get it looks good for a immersion but I'm a filthy try hard  and hate getting killed when I can't do anything.
did you even play bf5? if you did then you would definitely notice it.
Yes
"I agree with most of this list but some of the stuff on here is just not right. Like ""infiltrations'? How are those removed exactly because you can still go get what ever flags. I can think of many bf maps going back that don't allow for that tactic. Like how is it missing from this map but present in say Golmund railway? 

A handful of these things are basically just map things. We saw 1 map. Not even portal mode.

I absolutely agree though that lots of stuff is kind of missing from this game. Or in some cases not missing but they chose badly for the design."
"Out of curiosity what are you referring to with changing places in vehicles? I was able to do that (on PC), by using F1, F2, F3, etc. More than a couple times someone would bail out of the chopper pilot seat while I was a gunner and I would switch by hitting F1"
Animations
We gave up a full campaign for this?
Let's not pretend BF campaigns were ever good lmao
"honestly I really liked BF3s campaign for the most part, it felt really immersive."
BF3 has a surprisingly good campaign for a BF game.
BF fan since 1942 and I've never played the campaign in any release. I'll play Halo or something for the duo campaign.
I think its more the principle of it. BF5 had a (albeit shitty) campaign and still looked better than this. And I hate bf5
We are still getting portal and hazard zone. So it's not the end of the world.
It's still a massive disappointment for something they will charge 70$ for and still have a battlepass.
Nah its fine. A campaign would have been bad in combination with a buggy Multiplayer -> people would complain why they didnt focused every dev on the Multiplayer
"No it's not fine. A whole studio is making a multiplayer and another whole studio is making portal and this is what they can muster ? Bugs are only part of the issue, it's a month before release date, and the ""build is few months old"" is bs because I doubt the game would barely work few months ago seeing the bugs we're having. The biggest criticism are core features. You can't tell me that it's fine where a whole studio worked on a multiplayer only game and month before release they don't have such basic things as different skins for their operators on opposing team."
Than your comment should not be made in the context of not having a Singleplayer campaign.
Luckily I have ea play so I don't have to buy the game. I will play it and enjoy it just like I enjoyed the beta.
Dont know about this argument because IMO every BF campaign since BF4 wasnt really worth the development.
i enjoyed 1’s campaign
[刪除]
That was my hopes as well...more and updated BF4. Very sad. I guess I'm gonna be playing halo.
"They also managed to go backwards with the level of satisfaction after getting a kill (UI). BF4 was really solid, nice little animated thing and the points. 

BF1 was perfect, great sound design, simple text looked classy. 

But then BF5 just looks like a weird cod knockoff thing, this one looks even cheaper. Doesn’t make you crave the kills"
Sounds like you want a remaster of bf4. Tell them that instead of we want a new battlefield game. How are the devs supposed to know people want a bf4 clone when they say new battlefield?
"A remaster of BW4 would be nice.

You know what would be even nicer though? A brand new BF game set in the modernish era, that builds on all the things they did right in BF4, BF1 and BFV. Along with a solid campaign and no “live service BS."
Not my battlefield. I really wanted this to be good.
"Well, what can you say about this development process? They doubled the player numbers and made the game feel more empty. They removed factions and made it so you can't tell friend from foe. And those two things were the very basic concept from day 1. And nobody at DICE or EA said; 'stop this nonsense'. How could anyone hope that this game will turn out good in the end?"
"I also wonder what Dice/EA was thinking during production. It didn't help that they only allow a handful of helicopters and tanks at any one time. If they had more armor, the route between the building and the rocket would be more viable rather than an open road for foot troops to get nailed. 

The specialists need to be split up between the two (or more) factions and Dice needs to a better job anticipating the problems at the drawing board and not at the end of the production."
It will be delayed again
"I had some fun playing the beta this past week, but a lot of the issues made me reconsider picking this game up at launch. I’m gonna list the pros and cons of this beta:

Pros:

-	gunplay felt fun, loved using the marksman rifle

-	the Plus system for the attachments is one of my favorite features

-	Orbital is a good map aesthetically, loved seeing the rocket ship launching or getting blown up

-	had fun doing Battlefield moments like C4ing tanks from behind and jumping off a helicopter to sneak attack a camper

-	grappling hook is good, glitchy but good

-	riding tornadoes was fun

Cons:

-	Replacing classes with specialists, it doesn’t encourage teamwork since everybody lone wolfing it in this beta. It doesn’t even incentivizes healing, resupplying ammo, spotting, etc. Never saw any teammates use those equipment. It also feels like you’re not contributing in winning the match since all you do is just dick around get kills. 

-	Medics are pretty useless since players can quickly recover health. I would prefer if the medic specialist (Falck I think?) would use her med-gun to revive teammates instead of just healing them. I don’t like that everybody has a defibrillator and it’s no longer a part of a medic’s equipment. 

-	There’s no ammo resupply spot in the map and trying to find a player who can provide an ammo pack is frustrating. With these specialists, you can’t tell who’s running a support class. 

-	Medkits, ammo boxes, and rocket launchers should be tied to specific classes and operators. 

-	It’s confusing telling which player is your teammate or enemy since everybody has the same specialist skin. I occasionally would accidentally shoot a friendly thought he would be a foe. Can’t imagine 10 Mackays vs 10 Mackays in team hardcore. Should at least have faction specific uniform colors to fix this issue.


-	The UI is atrocious and overly complicated, looks like I’m in some shady website with random popups that appear every minute. Can’t tell where the objectives are at and who is capturing them. The killfeed only lists the player’s names when you kill them; no details like damage points, XP total, and other bonuses. The spawn menu where you choose your spawn point and loadout all terrible and confusing to navigate!

-	No scoreboard, how tf did they forget that!

-	Don’t like how throwing grenades require a two button press (equipping and then throwing), you can change it in the settings but you’ll end up tossing both nades. I read from someone that it reduces nade spam but when you change it, you get even more nade spam lol. I also don’t like the grenade button is mapped to the d-pad.

-	So many glitches and visual bugs. I’m playing on the Series X and the game is flickering like a mf’er. At one point it looks seizure inducing. This game looks more like an alpha than a beta. 

-	Helicopter controls are ass, had difficulty navigating the skies with these controls.

-	Camera is jittery when on a turret.

-	Spotting is inconsistent, sometimes it can spot an enemy, sometimes it doesn’t.

-	While I like Orbital, I would prefer if the map was a bit smaller so there’s action at every corner instead a few isolated spots.

-	There’s isn’t a lot destruction to buildings compared to BFV

-	Speaking of BFV, a lot of the other features from that game aren’t available in this beta. I haven’t played a lot of BFV, but there was video of the missing features somewhere in the battlefield subreddit and it’s kinda surprising that DICE would remove them in this beta.


I was hyped to play this game at launch but after playing the beta, I’ll just wait on it and buy it during a sale. Seeing it at this state with the game coming out in a month doesn’t inspire confidence that we’ll have a good, functional Battlefield game this year. I wouldn’t mind if they delayed it for several months or so. I hoped DICE would redeem themselves after BFV, seeing those trailers for BF2042 gave me hope that they will deliver. I guess we’ll just wait and see."
"Good Summary, the classes are horrible indeed and honestly the game needs a lot of re-work and a lot of changes."
"Thanks, bud. These specialists need to be reworked for the sake of teamwork. Keep the grappling hook tho."
"This is the closest match to my opinions of the Beta. Good summary of pros/cons.

Ultimately going to pick it up, but would be lying if I said I wasn't really skeptical with how much needs to be improved upon within the next month and half. I guess we'll see."
"Yeah, I’m not gonna pick this one up at release. Just gonna wait for all the issues to be fixed, or hopefully they’ll delay the game to fix the gameplay mechanics like the specialists. It’s a good thing I’m looking forward for Halo Infinite for my multiplayer fix. Can’t wait. 


I just found out my Game Pass subscription has EA Play included. Maybe they’ll offer a 10 hour trial of BF2042 and I’ll check if to see if the game has improved since the beta. As you said, guess we’ll see."
"Also patiently waiting for Halo Infinite. If all else fails, meet ya there."
"Looking forward to meet ya, Spartan. 🤝"
"Helis are fucking ridiculous. AA doesn't hit most of the time even when you run them out of flares, that's fucking bullshit. I don't mind them dodging it but if they're not staying still it'll miss. Either keep the AA as shit as it is now but with 100% accuracy if you can follow the heli and guide the rocket or make the rocket better. Also Helis respawn too fast. You get rid of them and they're back almost instantly. 

I get what they're doing with the sniper bullet drop off but the drop seems too sudden towards the end. If that's the more realistic way then whatever that's fine but snipers are basically useless right now. 4 hits to kill someone unarmored is horseshit."
"I was top 1% medic on BFone. I often would have a kdr < 0.1 and top 1 or 2 score just by doing medic stuff. People on squad with me would often have kdr > 3, because I'd revive and heal the shit out of them. I just can't be that medic in this game. During my time in beta, the only thing I could do was to get an assault weapon and try to kill. Why would I even try to revive? It takes 200 seconds and makes me extremely exposed. Whenever DICE remembers the value of squad based teamwork, I'll happily get back to BF."
See ya on the fields of Flanders my friend! Or the ruins of Volgograd!
"Cancelled my pre-order. I'm still hopeful the game will eventually be a solid title, but just going off of my experience from the beta.. it's a large no from me thus far"
"Same, thought after having two extra years of dev time DICE couldn't fuck it up..."
"Did they have 2 more years? I'm sure battlefield titles are usually 2-3 years a part for recent titles.
Although I agree they need waayyyyy more time to make this a great title."
They apparently spent those two years trying to completely reinvent the wheel rather than build on the greatness they achieved with 3/4/1.
[刪除]
I just paid $40 for Hell Let Loose and it is knocking my socks off despite launch week server issues. I’m not paying $60+ for a game I do not want in its current form.
"Same here. 

I hope they give the devs time to do their thing. This beta screamed corporate timeline bullshit. I get wanting to release for Christmas, but it's just gonna be ugly."
BOTS BOTS BOTS. I knew it was a little sus that I click find game and a 128 player game starts instantly from scratch. I only played a few games and went back to battlefield 1 and had a blast. This game has lost the battlefield identity. It’s trying too hard to be COD/ warzone and crap. The specialists and ability to pick any weapon shits on the very foundation of battlefield. The visuals and landscape is great. But that alone won’t save this game. I was very excited for this game but that excitement has vanished and will be hard to regain unless DICE somehow manages to make it feel like an actual battlefield game again
Sus!
Bring back classes
"the visuals just seemed off...overly bright + overly dark, like the contrast was off.  Was just hard to see anything like the game had a bad filter applied to it.  Level was TOO large and it felt more like a game of Warzone vs. other BF games.  Not a fan...won't be buying.

I'll never understand why they feel that they have totally reinvent the wheel with each release?  Why not just take a game like BF3, BF4 or BC and then just take those bones and improve it and make it more modern, beautiful and immersive.  I  WANT BF to be my favorite games, but they just fall flat."
"*""I'll never understand why they feel that they have totally reinvent the wheel with each release?""*

  Losing out sales-wise to Call of Duty every year will do that."
Because most gamers don’t have taste. They can’t try to be successful by imitating COD
"It would appear to be the case based on what I'm reading, lol. But there's no doubt they are targeting CoD players more than ever this year. Did you see that article posted earlier about the game's troubled development?

- *""As for the lack of creativity, management loved some of Modern Warfare 2019’s aspects that much, that the studio was supposedly encouraged to create something similar.""*

- *""It’s still unclear what other design choices came from Call of Duty. But a ton of Call of Duty creators (that have never uploaded a Battlefield title before) was invited to the closed Beta capture event.""*"
Yeah its dumb. Battlefield has always been about atmoshere and teamwork. With a little bit of realism. And having a plethora of ways of fighting. It’s looking as tho they are dropping all that in favor of skins and micro transactions
"I have not been a big fan of the last couple of BFs, but I am so done with CoD so I decided 2042 would be my FPS for this year. Little did I know DICE would be trying to turn Battlefield into the damn game I am quitting it for!"
At this point BF1 and BF4 are carrying the series. And we’re talking games that have been out for years
"How’s the population on BF4 on PS4 or PS3 systems? I went wayward with MW for a year and a half, but would love to get back into some BF4 matches if there’s still a pretty decent crowd."
"I wouldn’t know, used to play on Xbox but switch to PC after BF1 came out. If this sub is any indication it shouldn’t be hard to find lobbies. BF1 is kinda scarce but it’s also middle of the week"
"Fair, I got super into BF1 when the beta was out, bought a copy on Black Friday the same year it released, and somehow failed to pick it up so that game sits unopened on my shelf. Maybe I’ll check out both populations to see; haven’t been on this sub in awhile but wanted to see how 2042 was faring post-beta."
"Bf4 has a ok player base on xbox even today, usually you find servers populated. Bf1 is alive and Well too. I imagine both More so on pc, but I mostly play them on console"
">BF2042 is a ""love letter to BF fans

As someone who's still been playing on BF4/BF1 on PS4, they're ... ok. Like expect to only play Conquest/Operations respectively but on peak hours you can get decentish servers on the base game maps, I wish more people played the DLC maps :("
Can't argue that.
utter shit UX & UI design.
"I didn't like that classes got taken away, all weapons (like from bf4) are fine, but classes really make you need to work as a team

Edit: here's a list of gripes I made for some friends who couldn't play the beta 
Battlefield 2042 Review:

Performance/Bugs- 

-This is running really bad on my pc I'm having like stuttering/rubber banding with my computer at mid setting hitting (24-65ish fps) and a ping 45-55 this is such a fucking annoying issue and I don't know what's causing it

-I'm also having issue when I'm down where I'm just prone and ready to shoot instead of showing as down

-there's weird issues with parachutes not despawning, but either following the player or going skyward

-missing animations for guns like on a transport

-No order/comm wheel

-No Nade markers



Game play-

-Classes- they took out the class system and that's an issue that honestly breaks the game, and the operator gadgets are kinda useless 

-Vehicles feel OP as fuck since engineers don't exist and people don't carry AT (most are bringing health armor or ammo)

-Hot swap attachments system- It's neat, I don't like that i can't change stuff in the menus, and the small ammo pool is an issue cause they divided it between three ammo types

-Both teams look the fucking same and it make iff an issue, and confusing, plus players kinda bend in too much (and this is an issue that's exacerbated b/c the mash Q spot is now dead)

-Shit doesn't feel breakable, I'd like some environments that I can break

-scoreboard is weird

-some staple vehicles like tanks are now ""support"" you call in



stuff i want back

-Classes

-Building from bfv

-Disabling vehicle systems from bfv/bf1

-Spawn cameras (see what the player you have highlighted is doing)

-bfv Prone system

-pull ammo/health from support/medics from Bfv

-Tanks in spawn

-Arty I can call in

-Vehicle enter and exit animation

Conclusion Imma wait, no pre orders"
I think that DICE needs to address the specialist system and I think its for both DICE and players because right now it seems that core BF community will just play older BF titles through portal meaning they wont even consider buying passes or anything that dices is gonna be selling cause they will only care about older BF titles with new 128 player count inside a lobby. As everyone says they should make specialists sub classes under the good old 4 main classes and everyone would be happy.
"If portal really does allow for the traditional class system when playing with bf3/bc2/1942 factions, then yeah ill 100% be ignoring all out warfare unless they change the specialists."
I'll probably wait for a sale if that's the case. Not sure I'm down to pay full price for a battlefield game to only play one mode lol.
"I went in very very excited I came out feeling very very underwhelmed... So many things that need immediate attention. I've got this on ps5 pre-order but my excitement has really gone out the window. I hope they fix this game and it's problems before release. Just to mention the gunplay which I usually love from these guys, something just felt off I couldn't put my finger on it but shooting just didn't seem to pack the punch im used to... The more I think about it all the more I get worried."
"I've cancelled my pre-order on Xbox until I've seen some drastic improvement.
Idk how easy it is for Playstation players to cancel theirs but it couldn't hurt to wait and see if they dig this mess out of the pit that its in."
"If you don't like what you see, cancel your pre-order. That goes for everybody. These assholes won't listen to us if they know we'll just buy it anyway. If they have revenue coming in why would they change anything?"
"You're right, in guess I'm just hoping that come release all the problems I had with this game will be magically fixed... Knowing full well  that what I played is what I'm getting. They don't have my money yet..."
"As someone who has mained recon/sniper since BF2.   The bullet velocity on the sniper needs a buff.  Unless this sniper is just dramatically worse bullet velocity than the rest.

I don't need it to be BF1 levels.  Which required little bullet drop compensation unless they were super far away.

But BF4 levels would be good.  I can be pretty close to someone and aim at their head and it drops to the body.  It has the bullet curve of throwing a baseball.

That's my only gripe really."
"I hateddddd sniping in BF4. BF4 was such a step backwards imo from BF3 in many regards, especially the sniping. It’s weird how BF4 gets the praise that it does. That game was WAY worse than the 2042 beta and was borderline unplayable for 12-16 months. Rose tinted glasses etc"
"No.  You misunderstand.

Its current BF4 sniping is miles better than 2042.  not launch BF4 sniping lol.

Literally all I do is snipe so I'm super sensitive to this kinda stuff.

in BF4 you aim right at their head unless its got some distance and even then you aim up few cm's tops.

Granted I do 0 long range sniping.  Its all 5m-300m.  

In 2042 you have to aim above their head if they are within a stones throw.  And that's just wild to me."
I think the projectile velocity in general needs an update. The rocket launcher was a joke.
"I mean, it's called a recoilless rifle, isn't it?"
Ehhh same difference
An unoptimized alpha that masqueraded as a beta that only just illuminated for everyone how much of the heart and soul of a good BF game 2042 has gutted.
Please delay this game and take more time
I'm still confused why with 128 player servers we are still limited to 4 player squads.
Or 6 Jeep’s
Bruh 128 players? You mean 40 players max on each team and the rest being AI lmao
"Absolute garbo’ lol

They just need to remake bf2 or 2142, get rid of stupid unlock system, make defined classes, make good larger maps with destruction, make a clean and simple UI."
"From battlefield Bad Company 1 up until Battlefield 4, they NAILED the formula on how to create an immersive Battlefield that was engrossing and exciting. Battlefield 1 was a shift, but I understood the creativity in taking the series in a new direction. Overall, I’ve played thousands of hours on the collective Battlefield titles. And to see this now? This is absolutely terrible. I couldn’t play for more than 30 minutes, it feels like this game was released 8 years ago, being something that was competing to live up to Battlefield 4’s potential."
Bf1 shifted because it had to adjust to the change of setting but the battlefield spirit was still alive in that game.
"Yes it was cosmetically different, but after seeing the  negative reactions to the ""hero characters"" you'd have thought they learned, I liked being able to customise the face and general uniform of the class, not a whole specialist system, minor customisation is fine, what we got isn't"
I wish they would just go back to the older game play styles with updated graphics......They are trying too hard to incorporate with the COD crowd.
"My Hot Take That Nobody Asked For:  


*That's exactly what they want, they hate the BF community, and want to trade fanbases, we complain too much and ask for too much. The COD community is far more passive and typically just eats what is served to them.*"
"Mixed is the perfect word to describe my 21 hours of playing. Had fun moments, epic multikill moments, lots of confusion, and lots of ""HUH?"" and ""WHY DICE?!?!"" moments. 

My top issues are the specialist systems, no longer seeing teamwork, air vehicle controls are another level of confusion with a controller, lots of confusion on which is an enemy and such, and of course poopy bugs, etc. 

I know this is ""just a beta bro"" but honestly... i'm worried about the launch of this game. Have a feeling it's going to be a mess... I wish they could've given us the actual demo of the actually ""more polished"" game of the same map and the game's gameplay.. not this buggy ass beta. 

I personally support a 2nd delay but I know that ain't happening.. only hoping for the best now."
i tried both PC and PS5. The controller is just pure shit. You have to press twice to throw a grenade fucking lol. Everything is so much more cumbersome and the aiming isn't tight like warzone.
Grenade thing is configurable in the options.  Knowing that I'm sure you'll give the game 10/10 now :D
"haha, if it were the only issue. then yes!"
"Leaks from sources at dice and scrubbing through code indicates the build we played is a couple of weeks, not months, old."
"What I said on a previous post about how I felt about the game

I have mixed feelings on the game

The movement felt like it was scrapped from apex some of that has to do with FOV though I don't know why they got rid of V's movement the ability to roll to reduce fall damage vault over high objects, leaning, and crouch sprint was great although if I remember correctly slide canceling was problem also you can't dive underwater in bf2042.

Gunplay felt very simplified it felt almost like warzones like not a lot of recoil or spread also a big one there was no random bullet deviation and I felt like I was lasering people so there's no reason to tap fire which is weird because I have played a lot of bf3 recently and tap firing is something I do a lot

The removal of suppression and spotting this ones going to be a bit controversial but I liked suppression and spotting and I think they both need to return, suppression made it so you couldn't run head first into a gun fight because it would affect your visibility by making screen darker, it reduced your accuracy making it harder to hit the enemy/enemies shooting at you and if I am not mistaken it affected your movement (how fast you run and turn) as well. Then spotting also needs to return bf2042's/V's pinging system sucks because they don't stick to players and people generally don't pay attention to them as to where spotting was helpful and it made people aware of some dude pulling flank a hidden support raining hell on your teamates, enemy snipers, and advancing tanks or any other vehicle.

Destruction in this game is the weakest out of all the games that had it there where very few walls you could destroy and the tornado well cool and all it doesn't destroy much

The plus system is great but it feels like it takes away a lot of attachment variety I think the solution is to keep the plus system but choose what attachments I want to put on the plus system so during the beta the m5a3 had a red dot and hybrid scope what you should do is have the option to change the scopes there to be holographic and an acog or maybe a thermal sight.

Specialists these 2 videos explain my problems with the specialists pretty well [https://youtu.be/keA0qgWk4D8](https://youtu.be/keA0qgWk4D8) [https://youtu.be/9ZPZzSBVdTo](https://youtu.be/9ZPZzSBVdTo) but one thing these 2 videos don't mention is how useless the specialist abilities are Casper's drone is just a crappy version of the mav what ever his secondary ability is the heartbeat sensor is pointless Boris's sentry gun is weak as hell, and Maria's stim pistol serves no purpose anymore since you can no longer revive people with it and you already regain health wicked fast. The only one who has a good ability is Mackay

I am just gonna knockout some smaller ones the removal of the grenade indicator I really hope this was a glitch or they accidently forgot to add them, the revive system sucks so nobody revives, taking objectives feels very unrewarding, bots suck, UI is terrible, Scoreboard needs to be changed, Lack of a dialogue wheel so you can't request ammo or health, and finally you feel like a one man army and there's no teamplay so nobody revives (which partial has to do with the revive system being bad) or drops ammo.

Its not that this game is bad it just feels like its having an identity crisis it doesn't feel like its battlefield game but rather a bunch of things taken from other games thrown into a massive map with vehicles and large player count and Its missing a lot of features from previous installments."
I wish it had the gunplay from 1 and the movement from V. I hated that I would slide whenever I pressed c. I agree it feels like a ginormous identity crisis. If I wanted to play cod I would play cod.
I personally prefer 3's gun play just something about it felt just right
"Agreed, BF3 had the best gunplay, BF4 was a massive downgrade in many regards… especially the shit sniping of 4."
yeah I love bf3s sniping but I despise bf4s sniping and gunplay
"I feel like the map is way too big, few zones of interest and the performance is terrible, I was expecting at least a solid 100fps at 1080p low settings, but running 80 FPS average (rtx 2060), feels really bad, dlss will most likely fix this, but who knows, EA never misses a chance to disappoint me.
I was very exited to play the beta, was thinking of prepurchising the game this weekend, but I didn't enjoy this, will probably buy until it's 20 bucks or something, definetly not worth the $60 for me."
The performance was what really annoyed me. Ran Halo Infinite's test on max graphics 4k and had good fps with my 2060 but had to run Bf2042 on 1080p at medium to get it smooth - which ofc meant the game looked like crap to me
"I was even joking with my friends that no one would play halo with how awesome battlefield looked, looks like I'll be playing halo or something else this holiday season lol"
"To be fair in halo you’re running a 16 vs 16 on a small rather cramped map, while BF2042 is dealing with a 64 vs 64 with over the top explosions and everything.

That plus halo already looked outdated. 

I think expecting to run a new game on the lowest end card of (2017?) at 4K is a huge stretch."
"That's actually not even something I realized. Every time. Every match. Everyone fought at the rocket. I could go take a zone and people were reclaim it of course. But the bulk of everyone was always at the rocket. There's areas of the map I 100% did not even go to. 

How fuck are they gonna fix that? The maps are all probably way too big to accommodate the player count and when that happens everyone will just subconsciously decide where the fights on each map will be and everyone will hover around those areas. 

I didn't even realize this. Jesus Christ ... Has dice realized this?"
"I have no idea what you’re talking about. I played the beta for 12 hours or so and the fights were pretty evenly spilt. If you continually only fought at one part of the map, that’s on you."
"Playing this has made me feel old and cynical. I was so excited to enjoy it. I recently got a PC and over the summer I play a good bit of battlefield 4. The trailers they threw out really made me feel like they were getting back to that time. I mean Irish is still in the fight. 

I don't even know where my actual complaints are allowed to begin. I've repeatedly seen that this is at least a month old build, maybe older. So I imagine that the fact that my weapon load out didn't save and I had to select the items every time I died is probably fixed. As is some of the control and toggle issues I had. Couldn't toggle sights of from first to third in some vehicles but it was random so probably a bug. 

The movement I actually enjoyed. It felt crispy enough. But honestly the ""tactical Sprint"" is completely redundant when you do it across a 652 yard open field trying to get to the objective since the spawns seemed weird. But overall it was on par with warzone. But not quite Apex legends yet. 

The scale I actually have a bit of an issue with. I know this was just a sample. But i think it's insane that a map can feel both wildly overcrowded and completely empty at the same time. There was times where I would spawn on a random objective and there would be literally no one around for miles. I don't think we should actually be at the scale of 128 people per match. But I also don't like running for miles. When your at a crowded objective it felt claustrophobic. You could hardly line up a shot or take an objective without being rushed down by what seemed to 30+ enemies. It just got tiring honestly. 

The gun play overall was the weakest point. Not having distinctive weapons but just altering builds of the few guns I got to play with made everything feel like it was wrong the specific situation I was in. The standard m4/5(whatever) with a red dot and whatever barrel was good at medium to close range. If that's what I was using I felt like I was never there. Never doing enough damage for the hits I was getting. Switch it up to the heavy ammo and match barrel. Felt like the rate of fire was a bit slow for anything more than single fire. Maybe this was a me problem but I felt like I never had a good load out even when I was changing it on the fly which I also dislike. Again I'm old and cynical but changing a mag and changing a barrel are very different and I feel like the balance they needed to achieve to allow this on the fly detracted from the entire experience of the gun play. The sniper being the most obvious example. I don't this there was any point in battlefield history where a bolt action rifle required 3+ body shots to kill someone. Sniping felt so useless because it wasn't a true battlefield sniper rifle it wasn't the m98b from bc2 or the L96A from bf3 or the m40a5 from bf4. It was basically a bolt action dmr because of the needed flexibility they had to bake in to make it interchangeable. I'm assuming there's more guns. But I never unlocked anything. Which I also have issue with. Why didn't we just have access to the whole weapon system? I mean how much more unbalanced would having all the weapons unlocked actually have made it? 

Overall I feel that either my time with the big fps games is coming to a close or the market fps games are in is just declining and I'm no longer a fan. I'm honestly not sure what it is anymore. It seems reckless to put out a build of a game to the general public that's stable but dated and then ask for feedback on what they encountered. Did Dice do this so that could hammer 60-80% of the feedback with ""that's already been corrected"" to make it seem like it's shipping in really great shape? Or did the delay really mess up the build of the game we would have gotten to see and this is the contingency plan? I don't know. I wasn't gonna be a day one customer before this and I still do not intend to be. I would like to see the other maps and maybe the rest of the weapons. But I'm not sure when I'll pick this one up. I hope they get it locked down for everyone that is getting it on release though."
">The scale I actually have a bit of an issue with. I know this was just a sample. But i think it's insane that a map can feel both wildly overcrowded and completely empty at the same time. There was times where I would spawn on a random objective and there would be literally no one around for miles. I don't think we should actually be at the scale of 128 people per match. But I also don't like running for miles. When your at a crowded objective it felt claustrophobic. You could hardly line up a shot or take an objective without being rushed down by what seemed to 30+ enemies. It just got tiring honestly.

In fairness DICE cant force players to go to anywhere specific on the map. I have had epic fights on ALL the flags. You can be on a flag and all is quite (like the C flags) then all hell breaks loose.   


It did seem like players naturally gravitated to B flag on the roof, D flags fight through the tunnels. I never understood the fascination with fighting like that. The D flag tunnel reminded me of Metro (I do not like meat grinder maps lol)

&#x200B;

I played matches with 3 friends and 2 have never played. Guess what flag they went right to and stayed there for sometime. I was like can we go actually cap some other flags please this is boring!

&#x200B;

All in all the full retail game we will know for sure. It is hard to judge the game based on ONE map ONE mode and limited weapons that we can not change the attachments in the plus system (We will be able to on release..confirmed!)"
This was something i genuinely didn't realize was even happening until I was in this thread reflecting on it. There's parts of that map I never even seen. It was so big but almost pointless to spawn anywhere other than the rocket. I don't know how dice balances that and gets players to go to other objectives but I've never seen almost two entire teams just focus on two objectives and ignore a whole map
"> There's parts of that map I never even seen. 

&#x200B;

I think part of the problem for the beta was the MAP button did not work. So you have this huge map and no idea where anything is. So people seemed to gravitate towards the largest structures. The Rocket and the large building (B Flag). 

&#x200B;

Being that I dumped 25 hours into the game I ended up knowing exactly where every flag was without needing the map."
"It’s kinda on DICE to build a map where the combat naturally ebbs and flows throughout the map. Not the way it is now, though."
"You can build a map and hope it flows a certain way. Then let people play it and they do the opposite of what you hoped lol.   


I am sure DICE will make changes to Orbital based on there data from the BETA and maybe even other maps if they realize people are not going to certain areas.

&#x200B;

I do agree that there is a skill to making maps that work.

&#x200B;

I am sure DICE knew that people would gravitate towards the B flag on top of the roof. It is exactly what my buddies did the first time they played. I had already had time in the beta. We spent more time then I cared for up there on that roof."
"Definitely the latter on the ""either I'm old or new shooters suck"" question.  

Theres been a few new shooters that have been hits and all the classic shooters, which are legends of their own, are trying to take aspects of the newer games to try and chase the trend. The result is a shitty game. Battlefield has absolutely no business being a hero shooter and yet here we are."
"While I didn't dislike my time on the beta, I also didn't enjoy it as much as if I had spent the same time playing BF4 with the same friends. 

I don't know what kind of feedback to provide since they said that it was a months old build of the game. How are players to know what has already been fixed and what hasn't?  Or even what is and isn't a bug, when there were so many?

That being said, some general feedback I can provide as to why my friends and I didn't enjoy it is that the immersion was so weak. There was no weight to player movement. Gunplay felt incredibly boring. Animations were clunky. Sounds were hollow. 

BF4 had its issues but for the most part it absolutely nailed all of the above and it has managed to keep a dedicated player base for 8 years because of it. Based on my experience this weekend, I doubt that 2042 will have the same prosperous future, and I will be thinking twice about purchasing this game in November."
"EA/dice need to see this. Diehard bf fan here. Very let down. The ttk is ridiculous, the great bf sound design, gunplay, mechanics etc are all completely gone. Feels like a massive cod game from 5 years ago."
What weapon were you using? There were som balancing issues (LMG lol) but I found the main TTK just fine.
>If you wait 2 weeks before buying the game it will go on sale for half price like they did on the last one.
"Totally agree about the player movement, it’s too quick."
"The ""months old build"" thing is a lie as per some leaks from dice and people finding weeks old timestamps within code. 
Plus its a line used time and again in the game industry. Halo Infinite tried to use it (they had the sense to delay after realizing they couldn't get away with it) Cyberpunk tried to use it.  

I simply do not buy it."
"I really like the setting, gunplay, vehicle play (condor is mad fun), 128 players is long overdue. I like the art style as well. 

But the specialists as they are currently implemented are really bad. This system is making the whole game feel weird.

If this game had specialists as purely cosmetic options, the traditional class system, and all of their gadgets in the unlock pool, the game would bee 100x better.

Even beyond that, they make visually identifying enemies and what kind of loadout they have near impossible. Battlefield has always sort of struggled with enemy visibility and this really exasperates it.

Incentive for real teamwork and squad play is also being very heavily affected by specialists as well and this is the worst I've seen it in a long time. 

I have game pass ultimate for a few months. So I'll wait to see how portal is. If it allows you to play 2042 with traditional class system along with the additional maps and content, then great I'll spend my time on portal.

If portal sucks, then I'll pass on buying this game unless significant changes are made. We will see."
"Specialists are the main problem of this game.
Jet gameplay is atrocious, you can't pull up/down with a mouse unlike pretty much all of the battlefields before.
Movement is way to apex and warzone like.
But specialists are definitely the immersion breaking, solo play style encouragement problem of this game."
You can use the mouse...
"No you literally cant pull up/down with your mouse, i mean that its just too hard its like the sensitivity is just super low while its not actually a sensitivity issue."
Have you tried slowing down? I would imagine turning an actual jet at full throttle is a bit difficult.
"Yes i have, the difference is, at full speed if i use a key bind to throttle up and down it works fine, but with the mouse it doesnt."
"I'm in the camp of waiting a few months now to see if they fix the issues I had with the beta.

If they do, I'll pick it up at a reduced price and I'll have no headaches like at every launch.

&#x200B;

If they keep the casual approach, then great, I didn't waste any money.

Win win for me."
"I have only one serious Complain and its the Specialists-System! The funny Thing about the Specialists is that noone tend to be a Specialist anymore, because you have too much Freedom with your Weapon and Gadget Choises. (Engineers running around with Sniperrifles - noone is repairing, reviving). And everyone looks the same! Thats even the worst of it in my opinion. 

The Rest are gameplay design choices i can get along with. I liked the Gun handling and realy like the Plus-System. The Map was also awesome! Feels really immersive."
"I would be ok with another delay at this point if it means all this BULLSHIT is fixed, but it probably won't happen. Cancel your pre-orders."
"Yeah a delay won't fix this, cause i highly daubt that they will revampt the class / specialists systems. I was about to preorder for the beta but now i am glad that i didnt. I will wait for the launch and see how the games evolves. Its just sad, cause i was so hyped for a new modern themed BF. 

From the comments i read the last days i think the highest compliment for the BF-Series is, that most people just want this game to be good. They want to enjoy it. 

But EA/Dice regulary just throw a wrench in the works."
"For real, delay until March. Spend the rest of October playing BF4 and asking questions like ""are we really doing better""

Then spend October to March removing the new bullshit."
"See I like the freedom to choose the gun I want. In older battlefields I would avoid playing as an engineer because I hated the weapon choices even though I wanted to use a repair tool. Now I can use the repair tool without compromising my weapons choice. 

I could get behind some restrictions though. Like you can’t pair a sniper with an ammo box. But for the most part you should be able to be free to use what you want."
"To be honest i do like a free weapon choice as well. Nonetheless i think this game needs classes, that define the gadget you can chose."
As long as I can use any gun I want I’m fine with it.
Well I’ll tell you one thing- the WW3 devs are probably popping champagne bottles after this weekend beta. I expected their game to dissolve into nothing on 2042 launch but it’s looking like they might deliver a more BF experience than BF. Specialists and gameplay in general feels like a freemium ripoff of an actual BF game.
"Have you played Insurgency Sandstorm, and if so how does the gunplay in WW3 compare? 

I’m loving Insurgency, maybe I’ll enjoy WW3 as well?"
Personally I haven’t played it since the revamp the game has been going under for the last year or so but I’ve heard good things. I’d say it’s definitely gunplay closer to BF3/4 than Sandstorm but it’s definitely leagues above 2042 from what I’ve played.
"Hey there, what is WW3?"
"World War 3, it’s a very similar game to Battlefield that is currently down for renovations though it is apparently launching again soon as F2P I believe."
Am I the only one who hates the over abundance of the cyan color in the UI? I tried changing the colorblind options but everything was the same and all those bright highlights are very annoying to me.
"You are not alone. The UI was extremely jarring for me, and I honestly thought I might've just been experiencing bugs, until I saw a couple of other comments about it.

There needs to be a way to adjust the HUD in a couple of ways. We need to be able to lower the saturation and scale the elements' sizes, at the very least. I would like different colors and shapes, as well.

It's overly bright, obfuscating, and distracting. ""Immersion"" isn't a term I often use myself for describing how I feel about games, but the HUD very much contributed to me never feeling engrossed by the gameplay, other issues notwithstanding."
Cancelled my pre-order after my first playtest. Been playing the series since Codename Eagle and I thought BFV was it's lowest point (though I still put in 200 hours) but boy how wrong was I.
How is the release version on 2042? That bad huh
So disappointed. I just wanted them to bring bf3/4 into the modern day. It’s sad to see that COD modern warfare managed to make a more realistic modern shooter. i want my money back EA
Don’t preorder dude.
"Probably gonna be the first Battlefield I pass on for launch, been playing since Battlefield Vietnam. The game gets boring for me after 1-2 rounds, the other issues in previous installments have usually been bugs or balance issues As it stands there are a few other big titles coming out around the same time and I just don't see a reason to invest my time in this game over others. I'm sure it will sell a record number of copies or whatever, but post-launch is gonna die out fast the way it is.

Disappointing it went in this direction, but the industry is increasingly moving away from making games for people like me these days"
"I totally agree. It will be the first one for me too, and honestly it is so heartbreaking. I was so excited for it and it was depressing that the beta just lacked the fun that battlefield has been known for. Really hope they fix it."
What games are you interested in? I've been looking to the end of the year but haven't really been hyped about anything tbh
Try out squad if you're looking for teamplay and tacticts gameplay
"I had alot of fun with it, despite it’s issues. Here are some things I’d like to see improved on/changed:

- Gadgets exclusive to certain specialists; only support specialists can use ammo/medic crates, only engineer specialists can use missile launchers, etc. Universal primary weapons is fine imo

- Specialists outfits should have different color schemes depending on what team they’re on. Doesn’t have to drastically different, but at least something to help identify teammate from enemy easier. 

- Aim assist on console. Don’t know if it’s just turned off for the beta, or what, but having no aim assist while fighting PC players is a night and day difference.

- Obviously performance improvements.

- I’m going to assume features like the commorose weren’t in the beta due to it being an older build, but if that’s not the case, they should bring them back.

- Animations look good, but need some fine tuning.

- Audio mixing needs work. Everything seems to be at the exact same volume, making it hard to locate targets. Audio design is great though.

- ARs seem a bit too dominant, especially the M5A3. They don’t need a massive nerf, but something so that they’re not the obvious choice for pretty much all engagements.

That’s pretty much it. If they can squash all the performance issues/glitches, and change a few gameplay features, they’ll have a pretty solid game."
Finally someone who articulates their opinion adequately.
"I'm pretty sure there was aim assist, it just more subtle unlike Halo and cod. Doesn't drag against your movement, which I prefer"
Make cover more of a thing: add peek ability.
"Dude!! Why TF did they remove corner peeking! 
  
Honestly I’m not liking the hectic pace of this one… it feels more like a COD."
"Graphics are disappointing compared to previous bf, no classes, no team distinction, unsatisfying vehicles and sniping, UI is no good (I don't even consider that a scoreboard) AND the worst destruction of any bf game? 

I can only hope Portal will make up for what feels like a battle royal game made to be somewhat battlefield-ish. Please consider delaying release"
"There's so much I can say but I'd be just reiterating whatever everyone else has said.  I have been waiting since BF4 for a new actual BF game and hopped on this beta with excitement.... that excitement got extinguished like pouring a bucket of water on a lit match.      

I get it, it's a beta. But there are changes to the core of the game that shouldn't have been made. And for some of the fixes that need to be made... I can't see devs pulling out a miracle to fix it before launch.      
     
Replacing classes with specialists was not a good idea. Why fix something that's not broken? People are going to start making META builds and that will make the game just another dumb ass COD.     
     
P.S. I'm considering canceling my pre-order and I have never done that for another BF game. When the beta ended I had no real emotions for it. I actually stopped playing the beta a day early."
"I'm so sad after playing the beta. First of all the performance was horrible. I upgraded my old rig to a 11700k and a 3070ti to really enjoy the visuals DICE games usually have, but at high settings at 1080p my computer hovers around 80-90 with huge drops to 50-60 when i'm standing at a vantage point. But in all honesty the game doesnt even look that good. Fired up BFV to compare and it looks and runs SO much better!

Secondly - who wants to play as someones grandmother in a war simulator? Seriously? I LOVED feeling like a top trained Spetznaz or a Green Beret in BF3/4, so far we're stuck with a grey haired old lady, fat guy joe, fisherman Ray, or generic lookin' zipline Tom. DICE last games has become the definition of politcal correctness, and it sucks."
"Yeah performance is really bad even on high end hardware so I don't know how people with ""normal"" machines are coping.

I have 11400k and 6700xt and at 1080p it was only around 80 at high settings with good few dips.

I also think the game is visually not very impressive for a new battlefield title."
I agree
I couldn’t get 30 fps 1050ti
"&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|3xz2BLBOt13X9AgjEA)"
I am surprised your PC didn't explode in a ball of flames.
"To be fair though, they DO list 1050ti in minimum specs. The fact that you can't get stable 30FPS on the minimum settings is still worrying."
Yeh that’s probably fair.
What?
Not getting 30fps on one of the worst cards released 5 year ago.
"1050 ti is not one of the ""worst cards"". It was actually a very good value back when GPU prices weren't horrible. It's a mid-range card that suits me for the games I play. I still get 140 fps on bf4. No need to put it down. This game being direct x 12 only is what hurts the performance."
"Ohh my bad, the champion of the 1030 lol"
Shut up
Fuck I can’t get 30fps on my Super Nintendo playing the beta. Can’t believe it
Haha who hurt you?
"Really not liking this whole operators thing, doesn't feel like battlefield"
Feels like it wants to compete with Apex and Warzone in its style and level of mechanics but on top of a $60 dollar price point.
"Some things that I'd like to be improved;

\-Performance was really horrible. Not acceptable so hopefully this is a ""beta"" thing. I got like \~110fps on lowest possible settings (1440p) with a 5900x with GPU usage sitting at 80ish%. I'd imagine lower end hardware would have a hard time.

\-Despite Nvidia reflex ON it felt like the mouse would ""lag"" a tad during the heaviest of combat.

\-Something is really off with mouse sensitivity. I tried replicating my BFV settings but ... i dunno.

\-With ADS FOV on the scopes felt like they had no zoom at all?

\-Very laggy (internet), lots of rubberbanding and overall despite playing with 30ms it felt more like 150ms constantly.

\-Same operators being for both teams is confusing.

\-Why are there two different sprints if there is no reason to not use the fastest one? I couldn't notice any difference between the two in terms of sprint out times and what not but then again I didnt record a video and count frames.

\-UI is really bad. At certain points it was hard to understand if an option is ""on"" or ""off"" in the menu. Subjective, but I also thought it was really ugly.

\-Animations overall felt really janky, very ""f2p-quality"". The slide just felt very off.

\-Finding ammo was a bit rough. I'd like it if at least the bigger bases/cap. points had supplies.

\-Some weirdness with operator items. Like shooting healing dart downwards is faster than holding 3 to self heal. 

\-Some areas of the map felt empty."
"Absolutely no squad play whatsoever. I hated not being able to join a different squad too, and let's not talk about AI...

I personally hate the crossplay with console and PC. When I turned crossplay off, I wasn't getting annihilated, but then I kept getting thrown into a half-finished match."
"the squad play is very important to a battlefield game and joining your friends' squad to be able to effectively play with them is critical, and I agree I did very much miss the ability to select which squad you are in."
"I thonk that the AI actually ran pretty well, driving and flying vehicles, using the full loadouts, reviving etc... 

They do need some better awareness, and difficulty scaling, but have a very impressive skillset."
"No corner peeking.
   
Why."
Yeah its pretty fucking stupid how they have removed so many core features that previous BF games have had. We cant even equip 2 gadgets at the same time now or at least have the freedom to unequip the specialists gadget
"Yea… I’m also really missing the BF1+5 addition of limited vehicle ammo and resupply stations… it added a great layer of strategy. 
   
I think they really are going for a COD and Apex feel… games that I give zero shits about and actively avoid. -_-"
">I think they really are going for a COD and Apex feel… games that I give zero shits about and actively avoid. -_-

Amen brother"
"It was fun, but it doesn't have the same appeal that Battlefield typically does (at least, for me), and for that, I'll likely be picking it up much later than I expected to.

The lack of dedicated roles means it's difficult to know who you can rely on for resupply, being able to change any attachments on the fly plus grappling hook encourages one-man armies (as opposed to teamplay), plus the added mobility of the game makes it a little more faster paced - which also diminishes the idea of teamwork (as it's easy to leave people behind). This lack of teamwork makes it feel like any other FPS in that, yeah, we're on the same team, and we'll run by each other occasionally, but we have no real interaction beyond that.

It feels like they're trying to be more like COD and Titanfall - and I have nothing against those titles, but we already have those areas/niches filled. Let COD be COD, Titanfall be Titanfall.

Also, it feels super weird for teams to be a little less indistinguishable from one another.

I was looking forward to Battlefield, not an identity crisis."
"Agree with you. We already have titanfall and cod. Battlefield was unique (at least in mainstream) and now we wont have this unique experience anymore, what we will have is something much closer to cod."
I played for 2 hours and deleted it and went back to bf4 which I’m a huge fan of. Bf42 felt light weight like a cod or an apex game more than the heavy feeling you have playing a bf game. The specialist system really sucks and I wished you had the old classes or created somewhat of a character creation system where we create the face/gender but the clothes change depending on the class.
"It's looking more like a COD game imo. I don't want the fast pace sprinting/bunny hopping/sliding thing like COD 2019, not in a BF game at least. 

Normal classes like in BF4 would be a lot better than specific ""specialists"" (which is basically the same as in COD but with perks) I just want to be a grunt or make my own character/s.

I love that it's a modern setting, graphics looks good.

The HUD seems like a bit too much for my taste, but I'm most likely going to play hardcore anyways like I always do in BF4.

I hope the game changes more into BF4's direction and not towards COD."
Bunny hopping LOL ..good observation
"I own BF1 and BFV, and that is the extent of my BF knowledge. I played a little bit of 1 before, and never touched V (it was free with PS+).  

I played this Beta because I have always been interested in BF as a series, and I enjoyed what I did of 1.    

This was just purely disappointing. From an outsider looking in, what I hear about Battlefield sounds quite grand. What was here was a pretty shit experience.    
There are a lot of things that seem fun, and nice, like I liked the attachment system. But everything felt so awkward and off.   


Movement felt weird, aiming felt weird, animations felt weird, it all just felt like I was playing a poorly made indie game made by a team of like 3 people and their mascot golden retriever. 

I will say, it made me download V, and I have been enjoying the hell out of it. I just wish it was a bit more modern in terms of setting, but that's just a preference of mine."
BF V is pretty good right now. On release it was kind of rough. Just remember getting blasted by like only two different guns because they were in sally broken. But even release I do remember enjoying playing it. The past few months I’ve been jumping on playing a round or two and enjoying it. I was hopping 2042 was going to be an improvement of what bfV is now
"I wonder if Dice are actually going to take this feedback into account and reverse the specialist system or just ignore it.

The game needs a delay until March in my opinion. At least until Christmas or it'll be a complete mess."
"I mean , battlefield have had a few rough launches …. A few. I think they can overcome it with time but yes I wouldn’t mind another delay, though I’m prepared for it in November either way"
"This one is particularly bad though. On a different level to the giraffe necks in Battlefield 3. The flickering, stuttering and clipping will take a while to iron out. That's before we even start talking about balance."
"TBH Dice just needs to abandon specialists. Work their gadgets into the classes that make sense.

A lot of the other issues can be solved. But one of the defining things about BF has been the classes and you just can't take that away and not expect their to be massive backlash.

Shit you can even work the specalist models into the classes as some being class specific if you want too."
"Yep, pull the BF4 soldiers out of the portal mode and use those instead of the specialists if they have to."
"They could just use the specialist system in swbf2. Give us classes again, make the specialist slightly better like have a unique gadget and let us use points to play them."
It would be better to abandon them but that’s Dice’s new brain child. They’re sadly not going to throw it away.
"Then the game will die after release.

Seriously going from 2042 to BF4-V is night and day."
"I find this to be utter bullshit

The entire time I couldn’t play fucking once and I was stuck on the welcome menu every single time I tried to play… I have tried as many fixes as I could and also all the recommendation fixes from Dice and none of them worked

Dice are failures if they can’t even fix a fucking input bug"
Good thing dice la is doing portal because the official dice forgot how to make good games
People shit on BFV which was actually a good game because of social/political bs and I guess DICE took the wrong message from it and actually thought BFV was bad
">and I guess DICE took the wrong message from it and actually thought BFV was bad

I know that the marketing did hurt the initial reception of the game, but that's a massive oversimplification. BFV launched with a ton of issues, and many of them still exist as of the last update. For instance:

* There were no pacific theatre maps at launch.
* There's still no maps from the two deadliest fronts of the war.
* The balancing at launch was pretty shotty, and the TTK update imo worsened things.
* Quite a few of the maps are bad.
* The cheating situation was terrible (I know there's only so much the developers can do about that though).

I'm not shitting on the game, but people didn't just hate it because of the first trailer and the ""If you don't like it, don't buy it"" controversy. The game was pretty damn mediocre on launch, and while it was on the right track, the developers still couldn't fix many of the glaring issues BFV had."
"There were absolutely problems but the problems were not enough to justify the abysmal performance of the game on the market. At the core there was a fun game there, as fun as bf3, bf4 or bf1 at launch (given all those games also had issues)

&#x200B;

The decision to start with ""unknown"" theaters of the war and defaulting players to female characters with the horrendous screams was so brain dead but regardless there was a fun gameplay loop. I do not get that from bf2042"
"no autobalance, no community servers, more hackers than any bf game ive played and you can't do shit about cause dice abandoned the game and no community servers, changed the ttk more than once even after public outcry, gross monetization, and much more. yes the social/political shit was dumb, but V had a LOT of issues."
"The point the person you're replying to though is that the core game of BFV was good. Add autobalance, community servers, anti-cheat, then slap the modern war setting on BFV, create remarkable maps and 2042 would be hailed as the next successor to BF4. It seems this is all DICE had to do to win people over."
"I had a lot of fun despite how obviously not ready it is. But that said, nothing convinced me to get this at or even near launch."
"Very meh. The pace was off, the map is fairly bare and the only thing I really, really enjoyed was the Osprey & the tornado. Felt like modern Warfare, with shinier graphics. Guns didn't feel great, very unbalanced DMR & sniper. Was getting shot in the back repeatedly from all directions. I did enjoy having a squad of friends working together though."
"There's an issue most seem to ignore: the spawns. Spawning on an contested objective spawns you directly next to the objective, often in the open. I guess that's the direction 2042 is taking."
"I believe that dice said that they have fixed the spawns, and it was simply a bug. I believe I saw it on Twitter."
I spawned in the water swimming a few times at one objective
"I like the idea of no-pats, just wished we could create our own specialist no-pats. How they look, gender, etc etc... and guess what, you can still sell camo cosmetics!

I like the idea of the storms and nado, but it felt so comical and didn't change the map at all.

I like the idea of a near future BF, but my god what was really ""futuristic"" about it? Final Stand alone felt more like BF2042 then 2042. Sure global warming and shit is cool, but the one taste of that we got felt like any normal storm with the worlds least destructive tornado ever.

Lastly, I like the idea bigger maps and the sector-divided zones, except the UI is garbage and Orbital was a mess. 

DICE had the right ideas, but fucked it all imo. Especially the no-pats, LET US CREATE OUR OWN! ITS 2021 FFS.."
"It baffles me that almost everything they've tried to sell with BFV, and were criticized for -  such as character customization, female soldiers and ""creative freedom"" in designing uniforms/weapon skins would not only fit 2042 setting so much better but would be welcomed with open arms by the community.  


Instead, they chose to throw it all out of the window in an attempt to rip off Call of Duty.  


This game needs another year. Bring back character customisation, establish faction aesthetics. Make specialists into elite skins and tie them to each faction. Let us be grunts again. I feel like this alone could potentially fix so many current and future problems with the game."
"Yea agreed. I mean it really just feels like they're trying to railroad every BF to have a certain ""BF Experience"", without realizing that the BF Experience the old games captured where due to the lack of railroading. 

Don't force feed me specialists, don't force me into certain builds and don't force me to play a certain way."
"Yeah, I've never seen anyone complain about the female operator in regards to her being a woman. No one cares, it makes sense in this setting. Turns out BF fans weren't sexist after all. 

I have seen complaints about her age, but that's a separate issue. 

The nopat thing was the perfect excuse to do that punk rock, five o clock shadow war game that they wanted to with tired, grungy armies... But instead we get a bizarre hero shooter"
"the removal of classes was stupid as shit, make operators into hero picks that you can earn through playing the objectives like Battlefront instead and put classes back."
"Cancelled my pre-order. Will revisit when there's a sale and the games fixed up, I really anticipate this one is going to crash hard though - even the Hardline beta was better than this."
Hardline was the release that made me abandon battlefield.  Was hoping 2042 would bring me back. Not so sure after the Beta.
"I thought Hardline was good fun but it was never intended to be a main series entry, more of a side experiment like Bad Company was. 

It wasn't even made by DICE. Probably my least played Battlfield title but I think it gets a harder time than it deserves."
"You missed out tbh, Hardline was actually a lot of fun. Sure it didn't have the main entry vibe, but if you looked past that, it was decent.

Hotwire (IMO) will go down as one of the best game modes I have ever seen in multiplayer gaming. Hotwire on NO RPG servers was some of the best BF memories I have in all my time playing this series. Being in a squad of 4 on car C while chasing car E, firing grenade launchers back and forth, dude in the passenger seat just steady repairing. Other guy is trying to shoot through their windows but they keep swerving. You finally see it on fire and you place a very well timed grenade launch shot right into the back of the car, it flips into the air, multi kill, you drive under it while its airborne and on fire, and people who are just running around the area shoot at you as you go past, radio blasting ITS THE SOUND OF THE POLICE, and now car B has a squad of 4 and they are chasing you.

Man what a gamemode."
"My experience was so negative I cancelled my pre-order immediately. 

It didn't feel like Battlefield, it felt like some indie studio looked at Warzone and Battlefield and thought ""how can we try copy both these games at once"". 

I've had Battlefield disappoint me before, but this is the first time I actually thought the inherent core game was bad, rather than just be disappointed that it wasn't reaching its potential or was buggy or whatever. 

I can live with the many, many bugs in the 2042 beta. We all remember the first month or two of BF4, utter nightmare but the game was just so good we struggled through. 

The core gameplay and game design though, just plain bad. Everything feels half-baked, drab, uninspired, bland, sound design is shockingly basic, there's zero sense of teamwork or cohesion, hard to tell allies/enemies apart, etc. 

This absolutely does not feel like the same studio that previously mastered audio/visual immersion like in say, BF1, regardless of how you feel about that game. 

I'm super disappointed because I was unbelievably hyped for the game. Unfortunately the beta killed my hype and interest stone dead for now."
Yep totally agree. Playing the beta has made me refund the game. If it turns out better at some point I might purchase it. I’ll be sticking with BF 5 for a while still.
How good is the population playing BFV on playstation? Having tried this train wreck demo ( deleted it after an hour) and not trying out V I missed playing a good multiplayer shooter. Last time I enjoyed BF was BF1
I play everyday and have no issues finding severs on ps4
"bfv is very active on playstation, i’m always in full servers"
It feels like it was birthed out of focus groups and board room meetings. (Which sadly can be said about a lot of games lately. They feel like they exist to exist.)
haha very well put. They've tried to copy warzone and have made a dumbed down battlefield in the process.
"Board room meeting generated games are going to kill the big industries, they're shooting themselves in the feet then wondering why they're bleeding out.  
  
Not bf related but this is what is happening to Ubisoft right now. They've gone so far chasing the green that all they've been doing is launching failures from the board room that isn't turning out how they want. Deeply negative reaction and lackluster sales to their battle royale concept of Hyper Scape, negative reaction to xdefiant spitting on Tom Clancy's grave, butchering ghost recon with breakpoint then oh we gotta try royale again let's drop a royale trailer that will garnish mostly downvotes on youtube etc.  
  
They decided Am I out of touch? No, it's the gamers who are wrong!  
  
I really really hope DICE is not deciding to do the same thing. They will have a lot of work ahead of them and years of disdain to recover from if they do. Like how IW lost a lot of people with the cod downfall following Ghosts and onward, and it took a full and really good reboot of Modern Warfare (2019) to get a lot of players back. Then Activision fucked it all up with hey let's do everything short of killing servers but annoying the shit out of players into buying the new cod and warzone stuff, and suddenly they are losing players again."
"That’s what these huge game companies do for games they need to make them a lot of money. They base their design choices on research that will lead to the most profit, not necessarily fun (or good) game design. Which is exactly why games have been dumbed down nowadays, since so many people play them they want to be appealing to everyone. Which is ironic, because if a game was made that went against all this (like how MW19 went a little more gritty) it would probably be the best selling game of recent history. But hey, corporate money heads are gonna do what they’re gonna do and we can only speak with our wallets. Which I have done"
This makes me wonder how many others canceled pre orders after beta
"I cancelled mine right before the BETA ended. Was so disappointed with the game. A few other friends cancelled theirs too after such a negative experience. Had a few fun moments but it just straight up felt like Warzone with capture points. 

I miss a lot of the previously used Battlefield features that made the game standout and play differently. Now it feels so lazy and generic with so many of these features cut out."
"I did and four out of my five friends who played it did. The fifth is considering it as well. 

I just figure the game in this state isn't worth paying full price for and, going off previous BF launches, the game will probably launch close to this state (or at least still very buggy) IMO. 

I can always pick it up for a discount post launch if, miraculously, a load of things are fixed."
"My friends and I all cancelled after playing the beta and then playing BF1 for a few rounds to compare. After playing BF1 again, cancelling was a no-brainer."
How many people still play BF1
"When we were on I think there were 6 or 7 full conquest servers in the US. You have to use the server browser and change the filters (follow this: https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/dm7g7y/guide_to_finding_bf1_populated_servers) otherwise it likely won't show any results. There may be more servers than what I saw, but I don't have the expansions, just the base game."
PC or console? I'm on PC
Console - I was on PS5 and friends were on PS4s.
Or why people still preorder games for that matter.
My brother and I both canceled our preorders. A few friends that were gonna preorder if the beta was good decided not to go through with it.
At least we still got WW3 to look forward to
"> This absolutely does not feel like the same studio that previously mastered audio/visual immersion like in say, BF1

That's because it mostly isn't, except for the name slapped on the label"
"Serious question, why did you even preorder it to begin with? Sure we've seen enough corporations rush out broken games that gamers should know better by now?"
Same I actually just downloaded bf4
I recommend Hell Let Loose as an alternative. It’s basically a more hardcore version of Battlefield that emphasizes teamplay and feels like BF1 does in terms of immersion.
"I actually own it. I haven't played much of it so far, I do play quite a bit of Enlisted and BFV as well. I really like WW2 shooters."
"It’s better to play than Enlisted. Enlisted has more content but it’ll cost you an arm and a leg to fully enjoy it, whereas HLL costs the same as a premium squad in Enlisted with free content updates."
I feel the exact same. Cancelled my pre-order and purchased Hell Let Loose instead. (Amazing game!)
idk what you mean but it still had the core of a battlefield game. It felt like a battlefield game to me at least. Sounds a lot like you overhyped the game and expected way too much. Just wait for more updates in the future/before launch and maybe you change your mind. Anything can happen.
"I don't think it's fair to waive it away as overhype or expecting too much.

I overhyped and expected more from BFV but at its core it was still a classic BF game with excellent gameplay and I still enjoyed it while thinking ""man this should have and easily could have been better"". 

BF2042 to me though is entirely different, felt like playing a knock-off Free2Play hybrid of Warzone/Battlefield made by a smaller team. 

Runs horribly, looks OK, sound is poor, almost no team-work, absolute mountain of blatant visual bugs as well as the usual technical ones, really difficult to tell teams apart, clones everywhere, model scaling is wonky, etc. 

These are super basic elements of any BF game. If this beta is the *best* they can put out there a month from launch after years of development, I can't see the final game being radically different. 

It doesn't mean I won't consider it down the line obviously, but overall I think it's really unfair to suggest people expected too much when this beta was so unacceptably sub par a month from release."
"I have to agree with OC. 

The close-quarter gunplay felt like an upgraded BF4.   
Everything else was plain downgrades to me."
">Sounds a lot like you overhyped the game and expected way too much.

It sounds like he wanted the natural thing given previous bf games"
"Hear me out: this game lacks a good game design. 

The major flaw in this BF is lack of simple information. Feels like the game assumes that you know EVERYTHING. 

Who is your team? You don't know, can't distinguish player model, the red sign doesn't help much, you can't spot properly.

How far is this shooting, me vs that guy? You don't know, scopes are bad and scale is terrible.

What this vehicle can do? You don't know, there's no way to see the vehicle before spawn and check toolset.  A simple inspect with info boxes before deploy would help a lot.

Where I'm going to spawn in my squad mate? You don't know, doesn't have anything that tells you more exactly where you are going to spawn on him. 

How can you tell your team that you have ammo box? You can't, they can't tell you have it either. 

Maybe that fella need healing? Don't know, he also can't ask for it. 

I played all days, didn't got revived once."
Needs about 6 more months in the oven.  This feels like an Indy game with a gimmick of 120 people playing. There's no team play and it's just a shit show of things happening.
"In BF1, I really liked how they gave context to WW1, explaining why the battles were fought, what their significance was in the war, etc. In BFV they completely did away with that. Maps were given generic names like ""Devastation"", with zero explanation of what battle they were trying to replicate.   


I feel like we're going the same way with 2042. Yes, it's a game in the future, but I'm worried that there is going to be zero lore around any of the battles. We were all playing this beta fighting a battle called ""Orbital"", with all these seemingly major things happening like rockets being launched with zero feeling of context. I hope that they bring context back to this game."
"Yeah. Like BF3 had Caspian Sea. A map set by the Caspian sea. Operation Metro was literally an Operation in the Paris Metro.

Instead of calling a map some generic name how about naming it something that gives it some life."
"Like calling a map 'Battle of Amsterdam'. After 6 years of war, the PLA was pushing for total victory in Europe. The first Chinese troops landed on the evening of 7th may 2042."
"Yes. Or for the beta map you could call it Operation Skyfire,or anything really. You could also have a text that explains why you are fighting on this map.

Lots of small things help out."
 I was just thinking this earlier. that was one of those small details that really elevated BF1 for me.
"> Yes, it's a game in the future

The only other Battlefield game to be set in the far off future was 2142 and despite being a multiplayer-only game as well, [had snippets in the loading screen explaining the lore behind maps](https://youtu.be/0AY28lpWlIw?t=25) so your complaints are not without merit."
i refunded my preorder after playing the beta...maybe later down the line it will be a good game..but i guess vanguard will have to do for now and the halo infinite big team battles will have to scratch my big team battle itch
Everything was weird.. the gameplay felt more like a free 2 play game than a 80€ game. It reminded me so much the game style of an old free battlefield game we had back in 2010 but with better graphics and for that it made me sick.. So i think i will stick with the older games like battlefield 1.
"I’m not to happy with the direction Dice has went with the character set up. They’ve completely abandoned the battlefield formula and just gave to much freedom to chose how you want your class. Sounds good in paper, but the result is that nobody is running support. Why would anyone use a medkit or ammo box when you could just run a rocket launcher or c4? I find myself constantly running out of ammo and I have to rely on picking it up from dead bodies, go figure. Everyone is doing there own thing, grappling on roofs blowing stuff up with their explosives. I can’t help but feel like I’m playing Call of Duty: Ground War. They should go back to the old classic character set up, that way each specific class is limited on what resources/ devices they can use. A heavy gunner will be support, the medic will be the healer, the assault will be the repair man/ vehicle killer and snipers will be the spotters/ “support.” A sniper isn’t going to drop anybody a medkit from wherever they’re sniping from…or…imagine this, you’re on killing streak but are badly hurt…you call out to a medic only to find out he has a ROCKET LAUNCHER! instead of a medkit!!"
I miss cover leaning. Has that feature seriously been removed?
"So many bad Decisions regarding the Classes Hit registration is sad af 

&#x200B;

I am sure the only thing that will work are the Microtransactions at launch"
"> I am sure the only thing that will work are the Microtransactions at launch.      
      
That's the cold hard truth."
Attachments and specialists are trash. It should follow a similar system like BF3 and 4
"\- medics are useless. nobody was reviving because half the time you swap kits instead of revive. bring back the defib tool for revive, not an interact key.

\- specialists are underwhelming and i'd much rather the gadgets that make them unique were just part of the classes. 

\- ping system wasn't working properly. nothing i tried to ping would be marked. 

\- the whole ui in general is really bad. no grenade markers, nearby medics, absolutely awful scoreboard, and the bar across the screen when objectives are taken? way too large.

\- movement is alright but feels like a straight up rip from warzone and apex legends rather than something of battlefields' own style. and prone on your back seems to have been removed since the last bf game. why

\- plus system was done better by crysis, a 14 year old game. and it isnt even that useful. how often are you *really* going to need to change things on the fly between spawns?

\- few people have pointed out that the sound design just seemed really messy. might just be on orbital. lots going on but not really much clarity to anything. 

\- leaning removed. why

\- graphics-wise it actually seemed a step back from bfV and bf1 somehow. 

\- enemies and friendlies look exactly the same. this will be chaos in hc mode without visual distinction between teams.

\- very little destruction. hopefully this will be different on other maps. 

\- just felt like a step back for the series. doesn't feel like a battlefield game at all because of all the classic mechanics from past games being removed and mechanics from cod and apex being thrown in. this isn't what bf fans asked for."
"The worst about proning is that you can't move while scoped in.. lol.  
That costed me so many lives ... 

About the destruction:

I think it's hard to judge the destruction because on this map you really only had big building that really shouldn't be completely destroyable gameplay wise. Think of operation firestorm!"
"Hardcore probably won't even be a thing, how could it?"
"it has to be, at least via portal. hardcore mode has been a battlefield staple since what, battlefield 2?"
I didn't think about Portal. That makes more sense.
"First time I pre-ordered a battlefield game, played three games and just couldn't stand it anymore
Went and redownloaded battlefield 1  
My god battlefield 1 even looks better...
Going to refund my preorder now"
The first game i've ever pre-ordered was WC3 Reforged... yep... never again. Atleast they refunded me.
"Think I'm gonna make the move to Squad or Arma 3, this BF just isn't doing it for me /:"
"It was fun but disappointing at the same time, especially when you look at all the core features from older BF games that they either removed or replaced. It really seems like theyre trying too hard to appeal to COD players which is sad"
"Slide cancelling needs to be removed, spotting needs to work and provide exp especially for the recon drone, reviving needs a rework. Visibility needs to be reworked completely due to specialists."
"The beta showed one thing: this game needs AT LEAST one more year of development. I downloaded BF1 after being disappointed by 2042 and holy s*** it plays, feels and looks sooooooo much better. BF2042 feels like CoD (not even like a good CoD)."
"BFV made me a pessimistic, cynical bastard.  When the reveal trailer hit I was the guy moaning “I need gameplay, theres spectacle but show me some substance, is making the maps 4X bigger a good idea, wah wah wah”.  

I also said “hey I dont know how I feel about a Battlefield game that pulled BFV’s team, SWBF2s team, Criterion, and the old DICE LA team that was detached to Respawn onto one project”.  There’s a *lot* of cooks here.  This is 100% all hands on deck.  Its been 3 years since the last game.  This is not a promising showing."
Reading this made me wonder why I stopped playing BF1 in the first place so I re-download it too. Definitely glad I did it but my only gripe was the battle pack system but gameplay and maps were great. Operations was crazy fun too not sure what happened to that game mode either..
"Destroyed all my hype for the game, def going to just buy the cheap EA pass for a month to try out the new game."
didn't think of this. good idea. They are trialling us so we can trial them i guess.
"I downloaded and played a few rounds of BFV to compare the experience and *wow.*  Night and day, they regressed so hard with 2042 it's shocking me.  Everything from animations, death and reviving, movement systems, gun feel, overall sound design, combat flow and capturing and rebuilding/reinforcing flags, level destruction, immersion, readability..

That's not even mentioning the hilarious bugs or the game-breaking bugs, the lag and rubberbanding, hit reg problems present in beta.   Or the UI... The beta seriously felt like I was playing a knock-off game.  Old build, sure? but it gave me such a bad impression of the game.

The only thing I really enjoyed in the beta was the vehicle and helicopter play, but it felt a bit off.  The helicopters felt a bit *too* responsive, if that makes sense, there was very little weight, I could turn on a dime and they accelerated crazy fast.  It felt like I was flying a Scythe in Planetside 2."
"Yeah, there's almost no momentum in heli's compared to BF4. I struggled to even test them properly cuz Yaw Left wouldn't work when bound to a mouse, it's like nobody tested that at all..."
"I wasn't amazing as a pilot but I could do some real work with the BF4 Littlebirds.

What the *hell* did they do in BF2042 with helos."
"Aside from the Yaw issue I didn't find them horrific, but they did feel so much muddier to control than the nice, clear and realistic feeling BF4 controls..."
"They feel like blimps now, sad sad lifeless blimps."
For me the game really feels like Battlefield Free. A game that's thrown together by a few community members in unreal engine or something like that.
"This is exactly how I felt after a few hours play....like I was playing a Free2Play knock-off. 

It's like a different and smaller studio was handed the franchise."
I actually enjoyed the beta alot despite the glaring issues etc. but my group kind of all agreed pretty quickly that it felt like we were playing a battlefield game that was made by Ubisoft
"I've had trouble trying to explain why it doesn't feel right, the comparison to ubi games is spot on"
IT felt like the old Medal of Honor reboots. Which just felt like a cheap knock off of BF3/4.
"I did the same with BFV (and I skipped V altogether after putting 1,000 hours into BF1), couldn’t agree with you more on the night and day difference. 

That’s a great way of putting it. Definitely felt like a free-to-play knock off from a street vendor who insisted I had to try “Bottlefield 2042,” and that it was just like other BF titles.

Edit: been playing BFV for the last two hours and it’s great!"
I hated nearly every aspect of BFV and even I agree that this was a huge step down. It's incredible how hard DICE fucked this one up.
"Ah yes, we are comparing Battlefield V that bombed, was perma shat on by this subreddit and had 3 years in a cooker to be where it is now, to BF2042 beta. You think that the lag and rubberbanding will be as bad as it was in the beta when the game actually releases? 

The core of this game is much more promising than ""hidden gem"" and everyone's favourite entry in the series since last week BFV. It's got it's issues (specialists, lack of class separation, UI) but it looks promising and hopefully the devs will listen to the actual criticisms of the game behind the constant mindless bashing of every aspect of it and work on it."
"People shat on BFV because it was disappointing and only a shade of what it could easily have been as a WW2 title.  

The vast majority of people do accept that regardless of whether they recommend for or against it as a game, the gunplay, mechanics and general gameplay are very good. 

So I completely agree that 2042 is an absolutely *massive* regression in terms of the quality of gunplay, animation, audio/visual design, etc. 

Still think BFV is a huge disappointment but I enjoy playing it."
"BFV may have shit the bed, but the overall consensus was it has really good gun play and it did. I played V last night all night and was just thinking DICE really fucked up with 2042. I think Devs in this gen will get so hung up on resolution that they’ll forget about core performance. BFV was 1800p on consoles but still looked amazing and the best part was it ran smoothly. Why not take the same approach with 2042. The beta ran like dog shit on ps5. Terrible performance. I just hope they fix all of these issues before launch. I can deal with the specialists and even the stupid gimmicky quick attachment system but the performance I cannot accept as is."
"Haha you’re so right. Every new BF the community shits on. As a BF vet, I could immediately tell that BF 2042 has loads of potential and ran much better with less bugs than previous launches. Whenever the next BF comes out, the community will decide 2042 was a perfect gem… makes me wonder if the average age of the subreddit is 12"
">You think that the lag and rubberbanding will be as bad as it was in the beta when the game actually releases?

\*Looks at nearly every Battlefield launch from DICE, in particular BF3 and 4\*

&#x200B;

[Yes.meme](https://Yes.meme)

&#x200B;

*PROVIDED* there are people around to slam the servers/congest it."
"Thought the same thing when I booted up V tonight. Amazing conquest games where all five matches came down to single digit wins over the other team, visceral and intense combat, strategy employed, fortifications that work and teamwork, oh the teamwork! Capped off with still amazing visuals and sound.

I just don't understand how they got 2042 so very very wrong."
"Melee in this game is so bad, I miss the first person melee kills, and taking dog tags"
3rd person executions are more monetize-able because of “look at my badass skin i bought!”
"Outside of all the more talked about positive and negatives, I’ve seen most people are kindve satisfied with gunplay but I seriously hated it the whole way through the beta. I’m not a weapons purist or anything, but I just felt all guns had too much visual recoil, especially horizontally. Shooting felt like a chore and the hit detection was actually bizarre. 

Obviously there are other factors that made it so bad to shoot at people, the terrible net code/ping/hit detection, smaller character models and crazy movement speed, so maybe some of those things will be better once the game releases but given battlefields track record who knows

Ultimately I spent the whole weekend trying to figure out why shooting people felt so unsatisfying and tedious with every gun, and I’m still kindve at a loss. This issue hasn’t blown up like others so I’m left wondering if I just had a bad experience or was it something i still need to get used to. I play on pc and have no problems aiming or hitting people in any other games, it was just so marked and pronounced in the beta I’m worried it’s going to be like that in the full game, especially if others felt the the gunplay was adequate"
Nah dude I felt the same way. Whether I scored the kill or died I was left equally unsatisfied.
"Bf4s visual recoil with most guns was insane, we got to use fuck all in the beta"
"I play bf4 a lot, I think the visual recoil is very manageable. I really didn’t have the same experience on the beta"
"1. Add crouch running back in if possible
2. Hopefully we will be able to see our team mates before spawning in like in BFV
3. Something has to be done as far as factions. I can not believe DICE thinks this is a good idea to have 10 specialist make up all 128 players in a match.
4. There are so many little things that are missing from previous battlefield games to list
5. Need Ammo and Med stations scattered around map
6. Dead enemies need to drop more then 15 bullets!!
7. A option to turn off the large circles for downed team mates
8. There was no options to turn off or lower opacity for world icons when you ADS. The downed soldier circle blocks sooo much I can barely see enemies.
9. To many duplicate keybinds. I have to go an change so many keybinds that are the same across the board.
10. Make the kill marker smaller, right now it looks like a cheap F2P hit marker like WarFace or Black Squad. I ended up turning it small as possible and lowered the opacity it was SOOO HUGE. I get wanting to be different but it looks cheap no frills indie dev looking. 

&#x200B;

Even with all that I had fun but the game needs work that I hope is being done. Can DICE survive to lower performing shooters in a row?"
I 100% agree with everything there! Especially the ammo and med stations around the map! For no.6 I recon they enemies should drop either half of what they have or have a randomised amount to what they drop (Bullet Wise)
Anytime I went on a roll with kills I was scrambling for bullets. That is when I noticed I was getting only 15 bullets enough to kill 2 people if I hit most if not all my shots.
I couldn’t even change key bindings on PS5
"A few have this opinion, but the air combat needs to be reworks a bit. I can be a one man army with the Attack Heli being able to jump seats take out a squad and hop back into the pilot seat before ei even hit the ground"
Specialists idea was the worst idea ever to put into a battlefield game no idea who thought that was a good idea I’m looking at you EA 👀 cause I’m sure DICE didn’t want there traditional battlefield turned into a hero skin battlefield. Imo keep these skins in store for optional skins for classes in game scrap the named specialists go back to basics with class rolls that’s what makes battlefield distinct and makes battlefield battlefield look back at older battlefields guys bf3-bf4 the community just wanted that kind of game just running on new gen hardware and just bit more futuristic where it’s 2042
"im not really blown away by the graphics which is kinda weird for a battlefield.

it was also not working really well on a 3080.

gameplay wise it feels also a bit strange. Technically really not what i hoped for."
"Personally, I don't think the game is ready.  Bugs were prevalent.  Performance on PS4 version was really bad during weather events or when too many players were near one another.  I strongly feel the game needs to be delayed for at least a few months.  But, since that likely won't happen, I'm just going to express that I won't be buying the game at all if released anywhere close to the state it was in during Beta.  It's not something I'd enjoy playing even if free, too many issues at the moment."
"1. Fix the scaling - size of soldiers
2. Make specialists unique US or RUS
3. Make friendly or foe distinguishing"
"I'll get it a year and half after launch, just in time for the beta ending hopefully"
"I enjoyed it for the most part but it didn’t feel like classic battlefield and what has made battlefield so good. If this is the direction the franchise is going in I could get use to it but like a lot of people I like the classes.

What I liked:
- graphics
- gun play was good and there was some variety
- size of the map and number of people was impressive
- the map had a variety if you wanted to play long range or short range you could protect certain areas and stick with it.

What needs to be fixed/reworked
- revive, 90% of the time I picked up the persons gun, I couldn’t figure out the sweet spot.
- hud, there was way too much on the screen. To the point of getting in the way of combat if you were running towards a point to capture. I missed or couldn’t see the enemy.
- it was pretty common for someone on my team to engage me because there was little indication I was friendly up close. I also did this because I died thinking someone was friendly a couple times.
- lag, when snipping and looking far people could jump or vehicles especially would jump around.

What I miss:
- the classes. I’ve enjoyed the challenge of working within the confines of a class. It made you play a certain way and support the squad and team. I’ve seen a good medic turn everything around on a contested point."
"Opinion of a bf3/4 vet(read my opinion knowing I haven't played bf1)

\-Gunplay

Most Similar to bf3 (except for the bullet velocity) in terms of use cases for weapons, the k30 reminds me of smgs in bf3 where the servers were so abysmal that you were dead before you could react.

bf4 made guns a little easier to use

bfv had actual lazerbeams

it is ok if you prefer bfv gunplay but I deem it too easy. I am biased to bf3/4 gunplay so 2042 felt ok - great.

I think suppresors need a nerf. even if increasing bullet drop and velocity is unrealistic, It should be needed for balancing purposes.

Snipers hit like an ant, the body shot damage is too low, and it should definitely not be outclassed by a revolver. (This point hits harder as armor exists in this game)

if they are catering to bf4/3 vets this time around then if the only attachments given to a specific gun are those within the T system, then I think that the attachments in this game are too few.

personal bias: I still want the guns to feel as my own, if I wanted a shotgun with slugs and a sniper scope, then I want to be able to do that (goes for all other weapon classes too), as impractical as putting a sniper scope on a famas is. (considering snipers can be used by any class, i don't think doing that would be OP). I also want multiple variations of the same sight (like with the k30). If I wanted an m5a3 with a cobra sight then i should be able to run the m5a3 with a cobra sight.

and please, fix grenade indicators.

\-Movement

bfv had sliding

bf4/bf3 everyone was jumping out of corners and proning in a split second.

I can see the grapple as being OP, and movement speed is actually so fast. (but overall, I don't really get people complaining so much about the movement, I can complain about the movement in the same way gunplay is too easy in bfV than in bf4)

each game will have people trying to make most out of the mechanics of the game engine, I can't imagine that when bf3 was created, the devs knew that people would be jumping out of corners.

\-Class System

Actually fucked and Identifying enemies is fucked.

always mistake teammates for enemies (personal example: [https://youtu.be/0igGenUT1DA?t=26](https://youtu.be/0igGenUT1DA?t=26)), I can't imagine that changing colors of each side would be the solution as then skins would basically not work.

if they wanted to fix this then specialists should have been faction driven, like Mackay for US and some other guy with another skin for RUS but have the same skills, but this far down the line it wouldn't be likely they would do this.

had one game where people actually know how to use their specialists, defending B1 is easy with multiple turrets on the roof but for some reason nobody thinks to do it.

grappling is very overpowered in the right hands and the cooldown is very short.

the stim gun is almost useless, who would think to heal people from afar actually when everyone is running at 22mph. only use case I could think of is a super aggressive player who would want to heal multiple times in a fight, then that would be > than a grappling hook. as it stands using mackay is 100% more useful for your team via flank routes and escaping a tight spot.

comparing to other games in the series, I think that as much as bf3/ bf4 is loved, those games could be considered broken if it wasn't for server limitations (no explosives, no famas, no c4, limited sniper slots etc). adding onto this fact, this should be what bf portal would alleviate, but most opinions formed about 2042 is comparing it to older games with admin driven servers.

\-Graphics

graphic options don't actually work as intended, low textures are still high def (this can affect systems with low vram)

game looks good for what it is, can't expect bf5 levels of fidelity when the playercount for each match is doubled and map scale is bigger, can't expect high fps when there are double the amount of vehicles than previous games. It's a lose lose situation for what the game achieves to do. That being said, if this still isn't the final performance we are expecting, (as this is said to be a months old build), then the performance is actually great, bfv I have 200 fps on average and here i have about 130. (3070 + 9700k 1080p low).

also most user.cfg command lines don't actually do anything, most likely placebo if you experience a difference (as testing fps in ever changing weather and environments would yield innaccurate results for benchmarking mostly).

and on a smaller note

\-Destruction

destruction is a bit underwhelming but meh.

\-Matchmaking

I don't know if it is just me, but battlefield V and 2042 have the lowest skill levels of players.

bf4/ bf3 had people who were absolute sweats, I personally can always get top leaderboard games in bfv, same goes for 2042 with full player lobbies. But I would be your average joe in bf4 in the middle of the leaderboard. (I guess that happens when there is no sbmm, and old games tend to have veterans who just play their game religiously)

on a positive note, ANTI CHEAT IS A GODSEND. bfV is full of hackers and is almost unplayable. even bf4 /3 has fewer hackers. Haven't encountered a hacker in 2042 during it's beta

\-Map

orbital is just too empty, I know there are limitations with making a larger map but this just feels empty. Still better than other maps in the frachise personally though

Vehicles (don't take my opinion here with as much weight cuz I play mainly infantry)

handling land vehicles is actually dirt rally levels of hard. how are we supposed to troll with jeep stuff when aiming the vehicles is hard.

grenades are actually overpowered, if people actually knew what they were doing, 2 people could take down a tank, as you would have 4 nades.

also entering a vehicle slot with a gun has delay, pls fix

haven't played air that much, had a hard time steering the jets, also the damage to and from air vehicles shouldnt be that low, you should be able to one hit rpg a heli as that took skill.

\-Additional Points

Capturing points takes too long when the respawns are too short, while being a team based game, past entries still allowed one skilled player to turn the tides of a match, now we can't do that even when we can see the devs actively push for player freedom.

I don't get how spawning works in this game as sometimes it won't let me spawn in an already captured point.

they should Reintroduce emblems

\-Conclusion

I don't think the game is as bad as people are making it out to be, but I understand the community's frustration. It definitely needs some work but that is something we are already familiar with in this franchise. Battlefield has always released in a broken state, so I can't see why people are glorifying other games as it just comes off to me as they forgot how the past games have released, and are also forgetting their reception to it (e.g [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV3xUyfYQdI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV3xUyfYQdI)).

IF YOU MADE IT THIS FAR THANKS FOR READING!!

\*edited header and fixed some missing stuff"
"Solid review. Think the expectation was high purely because it was advertised going back to its glory day, Bf3/4, that was my interpretation of the trailer and advertising. Then you play this and it’s like wow... everything has changed and you haven’t even done a good job in most cases."
"Solid review.   
The game definitely has potential, but it seems that the game is catering to outside players rather than the hardcore fanbase.   


I just miss the days of using an AC-130 in the middle of a dust storm like in BF4. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)"
"

looking forward to the future of the game"
?
Best review yet
"Very thorough review, thank you"
"Yep, as a fellow bf vet since 1942, I agree with all of your points. This BETA is far more fun and stable then BF4 was for the first 12-16 months post launch (pre covid mind you lol) I had a ton of fun with the 2042 beta, knowing full well that BF games generally always launch in a poor shape, but, I had a ton of fun playing 2042 with friends and I’m looking forward to the growth of the game. I do 100% agree that specialists were introduced in a poor way, and at bare minimum, there needs to be different uniform color grading from faction to faction."
"So Halo might be the best shooter to come out this year, huh?"
"Not going to lie, I wouldn't believe anyone told me that Halo is having a comeback and the newest and modern-era Battlefield would get Cyberpunk'ed"
"I honestly hope so. I’ve been playing battlefield since 3, but 4 was the last decent one for me. Halo reach was the last one I loved and I really hope the franchise makes a comeback."
CoD Vanguard is also looking alright!
"DICE needs to be reminded that Battlefield is not a hero shooter it's a team based, squad play shooter. Who in their right mind think that Battlefield is do fuck all you want extravaganza? how in the hell you scrap the only good thing about this franchise? **Classes**!"
">it's a team based, squad play shooter.

Hasn't been since 2142, but you know, keep telling yourself that there has been any ""squad"" play since the series came to console."
Just because you never had a good squad doesn’t make it not a squad based game lmfao
"I always have a good squad, the rest of y'all just suck at it lol"
I thought the beta was fun but I’v been a field medic since 3 and the rev system bugs me out. I just want defibs as a gadget again.
"I felt so bad for everyone I had to run past, I wanted to revive but I can’t mid combat when there’s a 3 second animation that leaves you standing there waiting to be shot in the head"
"eh, you could move during the animation. BFV also locked you in an animation, though you couldn't move"
"Yea I guess, but I also didn’t revive in bf5 because of that animation. They should just bring back the defibs from bf4"
"The animation actually puts you off reviving people. In previous Battlefields, you could sneak up, res, and run but it fannys about so much it isn't worth the risk."
It looses that adrenaline 4 had of rushing to someone while charging ur defibs and avoiding getting shot.
The auto heal felt fast enough that I didn't feel the need to run as medic. Rather I used armor plates since they won me more fights.
"So after playing a lot of the beta, I went a played a few games on BF4 and BF1 (my favorite) 

I can’t explain it but they just feel like battlefield, they feel like huge conflicts with dozens of soldiers fighting together as a unit to take objectives. The combat feels real and exhilarating and the gunfire is loud and it just *feels* right.

Comparing the two, I really don’t know where BF2042 went wrong, but it just feels wrong."
"Same, this is really what I feel is the definition of dumbed down. Everybody sprint infinitely! Everybody get all the equipment! Grapple horizontally? Let's add the anti gravity rope! Want team play? No commo rose for you! And spot button will give random useless info that might or might make a difference. 

I had fun with previous betas but I stopped buying at after bf3. 

I don't mind 30 seconds of fun over and over. Even the star wars game that was free on epic had battlefield feel
 
This one is currently 30 seconds of frustration over and over. Simply not worth my time."
"I agree that battlefront II at this point feels more like a battlefield than 2042 and I agree It’s just frustrating to play. I was playing on Suez and both teams were fighting over C, and it just felt cinematic to be part of this large battle. I didn’t have a single time where it felt like that on 2042. I was either running between points and getting killed by lone enemies or fighting on one point and then another and then another in like little deathmatches"
"Cancelled my pre-order 5 mins ago! Will stick to BF1 & V until this thing is post release with good reviews. If I wanted COD I would’ve got vanguard, the operator system completely killed the class system this game is known for. Playing solo was an absolute nightmare due to the operators, absolutely zero teamwork whatsoever and no reason for anybody to play like a medic."
This summs up what im feeling too  glad to hear others feel the same way.
"It just felt so un-battlefield to me. People that still have hope will say it’s just a beta, but the bones of what this game will be is obvious. It’s a drastic shift from what makes this series so appealing to the people that have been with it from the beginning."
Actually cancelled my preorder today
"Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.

I have checked 295,449,228 comments, and only 66,583 of them were in alphabetical order."
Bot good.
"I’ve been hearing that a lot today.
I wish I could see the total number of preorders canceled.

Hopefully it’s enough to delay it for 6 months."
Please delay this game.
No
"Extremely meh. Guns felt closer to COD than BF (and not like a good COD) and ditching the class system for the specialist system is probably the biggest own goal I’ve ever seen from a game company. When you can run any primary along with your choice of selfish class gadgets (missile launchers, armor, etc.) there winds up being zero diversity among kits, all you see is people running an AR and some kind of missile launcher. Didn’t see anyone dropping ammo, saw a few players playing “medic” but otherwise it was just a bunch of the other 3 specialists running around with exactly the same kit as everyone else, while using the same specialists as everyone else so that everyone looked the same.

Movement also felt like dumbed down trash compared to BFV, the lack of climbing/rolling/being thrown away from explosions really ruins the immersion. 

It honestly felt like a F2P game trying to be Warzone. I was super excited for the beta and the launch, but now I’m fully waiting for it to hit a deep sale. Booted up BF4 and BFV after to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
">Didn’t see anyone dropping ammo

So it is the classic Battlefield experience"
"Delay the game a few months. The specialist system is terrible. This will completely ruin the BF game feel, you won’t do it but bring back classes and scrap the specialist BS. Make the guns feel like battlefield guns, every gun shoots the same. All vertical recoil and not enough horizontal recoil, and the gun shooting sounds sound like plastic. This along with the 3rd person knife animations completely kill what make battlefield so fun, chaotic yet enjoyable and somewhat realistic immersion. The plus system is garbage, what makes BF4 the goat of the franchise is the constant grind towards mastering guns and unlocking and tweaking your guns after dying. This completely immersion ruining system of swapping attachments mid life kills one of the best aspects of battlefield which is gun adjusting and progression. Constantly tweaking your guns is a lot of fun once you die. Swapping attachments mid life just ruins a core part of what makes battlefield so fun. Why do developers do this to themselves? So many developers take such crucial and enjoyable unique parts of their game in this case BF, such as the class system, fun and satisfying melee and ripping the dog tags off someone, constantly grinding and adjusting your guns, and replacing a lot of that with some stupid plus system, fun and nasty sounding and looking guns, and you just butcher them all. These are things that should be UNIVERSAL to every battlefield experience yet you for some reason completely change the heart of the franchise. This game feels and looks more like cod than cod does now. How depressing😞"
Specialist won't go away since it is baked into the game now. But they should put specialist under class categories and make it so that guns and gadgets are not universal to every op
That would be a decent compromise and depending how it's implemented could get me to buy the game. Right now I'm disappointed and planning to skip again just like BF5.
"I feel like they took away the best mechanics of Battlefield, the class system was my favorite part. Also, the plus system ruins the game for me, like who thought that was a good idea?

If they would have kept the majority of mechanics that are in Battlefield 1 it would be a great game."
They won't remove specialists it's a key feature of the game for them now

Where can I find this survey to vote on?

"Ok thank you. It’s not in my main email, so I must’ve used my other for origin."
I played the beta for hours and I haven’t received it. That’s some dog shit.
[刪除]
"My invoices have always came almost instantaneously. It’s a shame if it doesn’t get sent to all of us. Regardless it would be a dereliction of my duty if I am not to voice my disdain for the COD mimicking aspects that Dice and EA are forcing into Battlefield sorely because of success they want to copy from an atrocity like Fortnite & Activision’s money hungry methods as half of the COD player base consists of prepubescents who got bored of Shitnite and made poor decisions with their mothers debit card that’s been saved on their account for easy payment. Hopefully this doesn’t bode well for EA since absolutely NO ONE asked for Specialists and the sad probability of a battle pass in some form. 

MAKE BATTLEFIELD GREAT AGAIN

Oh and bring back Ranked Servers<<<<<<<<<<<<<"
"Would of enjoyed it if it weren't for the poor performance, broken UI, broken helicoptor controls, missing features and changed revive mechanics... 

If it ain't broke, change a bunch of things that worked in BF4 until it is! 

I know its a beta, but some core mechanics have been changed that didn't need to be imo, will wait until it gets its first big update til I buy it and see how playable it is by then, I was considering pre-ordering until this beta :/"
"Played enough and canceled my order and will most likely wait six months to see what kind of changes get enacted, if any. I was very disappointed."
"Ditto, I'll wait till it's 75% off in a few months.."
"specialists are by far the worst part about the beta for me.

classes have been a core mechanic for a long time in the series and the changes made here destroys a formula that didn't need to be changed to this extent. no one knows how to work with their team and are more incentivized to play as lone wolves with every good deed being convenient and random rather than anticipated or planed initially before battles start.

specialists dont belong in massive team-based multiplayer with multiple on screen encounters.

that is a generalization of my opinion toward the new class system. i would then like to make a few suggestions.

i personally think they should use and improve the AI models, keep unrestricted weapons, lock gadgets and special gadgets behind roles, give us two gadget slots, and save specialists for Hazard zone.

the AI models are aesthetically pleasing as they are. additionally, they are already faction specific and even have 4 slightly different variants per faction, AND their own accents/language, AND their own callouts. i think they would be a great base model for custom soldiers or adding details that helps identify their roles better, such as gear being displayed on their person.  
  
unrestrictive weapons (primary and secondary) is about as unrestrictive as i would wish for classes to be. i personally dont want to see snipers with ammo crates and health packs, but at least all other classes would also have access to long range weaponry without sacrificing their preferred role or going out of their way from the objective to dispose of them.  
  
with random players, unrestrictive classes discourages strategizing and anticipating encounters, thus every good deed feels random and players are more incentivized to play as lone wolves; completely disconnected from their team. locking gear behind roles made class identification and teamplay more seamless in previous games than it did in the beta. you would then at the very least know who is carrying what and who to follow or who to provide the most resources for.  
  
if role locked gadgets return, two gadget slots need a return as well. the specialist gadgets could be sorted out and included, you can run a blowtorch and rpg again, and you can run C4 with ammo crates again.  
  
i think the specialists would fit in the hazard zone squad-FFA environment with less-on screen encounters rather than a massive team-based environment with more on-screen encounters. part of me thinks that is how they were balanced in the first place and that is where they will blend in the most as they are, lore-wise and gameplay-wise.  
  
its wishful, i know. but if i could make a suggestion that would be it. i know this could be a thing in portal, but it can only work if Dice creates their own servers and only IF they follow these guidelines. otherwise, no random custom game mode made by a random person will be fully populated 100% of the time.  
  
these are just my suggestions. its probably not the most ideal, but i believe it addresses a lot of issues with the game's core mechanics and immersion poorly presented in the beta."
"Absolutely specialist gadgets need to be separate, i dont want a drone, or a grapple hook, or a sentry gun or a dart gun i want an rpg and some mines/repair torch.  


Biggest gripe is being locked into one of those four gadgets without being able to customise how I play."
I second this
"I do agree with specialists point, but what if each class had a guaranteed ability (their current one) PLUS one of the class based ones of players choice (engineer would get repair kit/at mines/aa mines, assault would be AA launcher/AT lock/AA lock, ect.)

However keeping C4 as a choice for all classes (except medic imo, that would be op) because we all know that C4 is a meme and is rarely more useful besides rping as IRA and bombing."
"What's the point of specialists?

Obviously this is inspired by the popularity of hero shooters, but i don't see what it genuinly adds to the game aside from potential monetization. Why not make them purely cosmetic as selectable characters within classes, much in the same way you had generic characters in BFV? You could add their gadgets to their respective class and go back to the old system.

When you add a design element to a game it's supposed to make it *better*, not just different. Ask yourself what makes battlefield **battlefield**, and go from there."
"WE NEED WINGSUITS!!!

That’s the point of specialists. Oh and money! Gotta get them micro transactions!"
"It feels like they did ask that question, included mostly all of the battlefield feel (sandbox, large scale battles, and powerful vehicles) but I guess tried something new with the infantry gameplay system. kind of a bummer, but if they weren't lying about the beta being months old, and it  has better hit reg, smoother gunplay animations, and some decent optimization, it will absolutely be worth a buy for me. on the vehicle side I'm not a huge fan of how maneuverable the smaller choppers were, or just chopper physics in general, but it wasn't *too* bad."
"This is the first time I’ve cancelled a pre-ordere based on a Beta. I played for 20 minutes then was so frustrated at it, I deleted the Beta and cancelled my order. So disappointing."
"same here, though I did give it a few rounds before cancelling"
Haven’t most battlefield betas been terrible though? And always pulled through?
"I played bf3, bf4, bf5, And bf2042 beta and bf3 and bf4 just had me hyped and excited the whole time, bf5 was not as good but still super fun but bf2042 beta has SO many issues and problems that need addressed"
No
Did you not play BF4 beta? BF3 beta?
I honestly can’t remember. I’m sure I did though. I don’t remember any beta being this horrible.
"Oh yeah it was badddd. Falling through floors, shooting people from underground etc. The whole shabang.

https://youtu.be/IntTbl2Uw3M

https://youtu.be/1vRsLK9ad-k

Enjoy."
"Biggest gripe is how specialists have been handled. I say that just because I want the game to succeed. I overall enjoyed myself!

The issue: 
Specialists just aren’t that. They each have a gimmick, but are otherwise pointless, as load-outs are what have become the norm here. It eliminates the objective of becoming specialized in a classes’ strengths and weaknesses. Also, specialists MUST be faction specific for the sake of identifying enemy soldiers. (Obviously each side have a specialist with an identical gimmick)

The solution: 
Reorganize specialists to be within the old 4 class system. (Maybe make a 5th class like in BC1 if it’s needed to sell more skins.) Take 16 specialists, divide them into 8v8 factions. Take each specialist’s gimmick, and classify it under one of the four classes. Ferick or whatever being medic/assault for example. Boris being support, Casper Recon, grapple dude Engineer, etc. Then, give us back our two equipment slots. Have us double tap right on the d-pad for console or something to access that second equipment slot. I hate not having my repair tool and rocket launcher both while playing an engineer role. That way we still have access to the gimmick but also our usual combination of role based equipment. Basically, if you want access to a certain specialist and their gimmick, you have to run that class they’re assigned to. I’m not saying re-lock certain guns to a class, though I personally would prefer that, but give us back our designated roles at least. The current system lacks any team play as everyone is pretty much on their own, as the specialists have no specific roles at all aside from Ferick being able to revive everyone. There’s no way of knowing who has ammo, meds, can repair, drop a tugs, etc. and this SUCKS. Battlefield has always been about team play, and while yes you CAN get good enough to lone wolf, to really do that well, you have to have truly mastered the strengths and learned to compensate the weaknesses of the class you’re running. The current system in 2042 makes everyone inherently a lone wolf. 

Also, pet peeve; not being able to pick up someone’s entire kit bothers me. In past BF games I’d pick up a dead recon kit on the fly to drop a tug, to then switch back to my medic setup. I need ammo? No problem. Headhunt an enemy support player and steal his ammo. Incoming enemy tank? Oh look a dead friendly Engineer. I’d utilize all of the dead player kits around me to my advantage which was SO rewarding. Now if there’s a tank that pulls up, no more killing a support player and taking his C4. Just a side note."
"Love your idea and I’d even go so far as to say that they should limit weapon types to roles as well. Feels bad seeing assault type characters hiding in bushes with snipers everywhere instead of being front line.

I do like the idea of only have a specialist gadget and one other gadget though cause it creates choices. Engineers can choose to be vehicle repair oriented with repair torch or destroy with rockets for example. As long as they don’t release a specialist who repairs vehicles fast or something super dumb."
"Also: The scale is broken, and everyone looks and moves like dwarfs on coke.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/q51jf9/battlefield_2042_scale_is_awful_not_enough_people/"
My expectations were low and it still didn’t meet them.
"BF3 veteran haven't played any other BF since, currently Apex main.

To me this felt horrible, clunky, gunplay was not impactful and I didn't feel the skill curve, movement was inaccurate and clunky and unsatisfying. 

Was I part of a team? It felt more like some people I can shoot some I don't, but they weren't exactly my team and I wasn't theirs, we did nothing together. 

Couldn't get a sense of who needs ammo meds etc it was annoying, the character models don't even tell you who gives what it's so dumb. Teamplay felt literally non existent but then 1v1 fights felt unsatisfying and not skill based.

The game is ugly, even at highest setting it's just not nice to look at. 

Sound design is awful, BF3 was so excellent at this and here everything was just a mess.

DLCs aren't enough now they need to ruin the game by designing classes/specialists based on money and not what makes sense for the game, ggs only.

The UI was terrible, the killfeed is impossible to read quickly, the giant neon banners to call objectives are ugly as fuck and dumb, I can't get over how hard to read everything was.

I played 2 hours, enjoyed none of it and uninstalled"
Well done DICE! You convinced me to buy Battlefield... the 4/1/5 bundle that is :P Having a blast so far playing 5 earlier. I imagine after a year or two 2042 will be in a better shape so see you then!
"Unless they suddenly decide to drop/kill it 17 months post release, lol!

Nope, I’ll never forget how they killed off BFV just as it was getting good. 

Oh well, at least in that case you’ll get it even cheaper!"
All I know is I'll be playing alot of Halo
"I wanted a modern BF this time around more so like 4. Grappling hooks I guess is ok here but ppl hated it when COD did it. 

Anyway I’ve encountered my share of bugs and glitches (I know it’s a beta but it releases next month and I DOUBT it will all be fixed on release) while playing. I have a feeling it may be like the BF4 release. I’m passing. 🤷🏽‍♂️"
"I'm actually kinda disappointed, two things that really killed it for me was the movement (which is something I really fell in love with in recent BF games) and of course the specialist system. I'm up for new things but I feel that the specialist system will kill teamwork since pretty much everybody can be anybody and use anything(And I'm one of those who played medic). And as for the movement I think it's something that made BF stand out from the rest of the shooters we see out there, to me it was unique and really pumped you up to an all out war experience (let's not start talking about the 3rd person kill cam 🤦‍♂️). I honestly don't mind if the game gets delayed to address these two issues but for now I'm cancelling my pre order."
The beta made me an alcoholic
I just got on to play it today fuck
Yeah I was dissapointed to hear it ended today too. Was way too short.
I played a game on Sunday but the pc guys are too OP for console players especially helo guys.. kinda ruined the fun of the first 2 days. Tough to stay alive 30 seconds. These mp games become too much work and less fun way too quick. I wish there was a more relaxed squad coop vs ai mode.. maybe ill cancel my preorder for something else back for blood or riders rep. It looks great but its already way too stressful for a video game
">pc guys are too OP for console players especially helo guys

Turn off cross platform.

>I wish there was a more relaxed squad coop vs ai mode..

There is."
Ty .. Coop?? that could keep me playing. Was that the game mode in the middle??
"Not precisely, you could launch a game vs ai only

 or launch a game with your squad vs ai 

They're all the same multiplayer matches but more relaxed if that's what you're looking for.

The progressions works with whatever you wanna play, so there are no compromises there."
Thanks i appreciate the reply
"I think DICE needs to bite the bullet and bring back traditional spotting to alleviate some of the game play issues. It is kind of odd since if you try adding a suppressor in the beta, the description tells you the suppressor will stop you from being spotted on the map when you fire your gun."
"Not a long time BF player… did quite a bit in BF3 and BFV but that’s really it.

What I really enjoyed in BFV is the emphasis on working as a squad/team. I feel this is one of the number one things that sets BF apart from other games.

I only had a few hours with the 2042 beta, but it just felt so… off. There was almost zero squad/team play. Everyone was just running around randomly. I’m not sure how they fix this, because it would need some major changes to what they’ve already done."
"I would honestly just change the specialists to cosmetic, like, what Modern Warfare did was pretty cool in that regard, you got cool characters with really good backstories. 

Sometimes you have good ideas, sometimes you have bad ideas, and this one appears to be a bad idea."
[已移除]
Yea bf3 felt ahead of it's time and still feels/looks better than 2042
"Go back and play BF3, NO IT DOES NOT. See, this is the problem I have with a lot of people talking about this game. Have you played 3 recently? It's a clunkfest and a half, and really doesn't hold up all that well both graphically and gameplay wise, 4? Absolutely, 4 holds up EXTREMELY WELL, but I think 2042 still beats it out from a visual and gameplay mechanic

&#x200B;

Also, something NO ONE is talking about in regards to visuals, the beta was 18gb all said and done, there's a very good chance we weren't even getting full resolution textures given that it was like a 3 month old build of the game. This build is probably from late July-early August."
I play bf3 ona regular
"I just have no clue where you're coming from with that then, because it definitely does not look/play better"
It does
How would you say BF3 is clunky? I play 3 and 4 on PC periodically and I don't think they feel clunky unless you're used to playing Warzone or Apex as your point of reference.
"4 still feels really good. I just hate the sounds of that game. Everything else is amazing.

3 to me feels like your guy is just SLOW. I don't play either of those, but I did like the movement in MW2019, your guy could haul ass if he needed too, but was never so fast that it was insane. He also had some weight to him when he ran, you could hear his gear sloshing around with all the weight."
"It's been a few months since I last played MW2019 but I feel like the difference in movement between BF3 and BF4 is nowhere near as dramatic as the difference between BF4 and MW. I like MW movement as well but it feels a lot faster and more agile than Battlefield, not accounting for head bob and audio, etc. which might make it feel weightier. 

I may have to admit to myself eventually that these games aren't being made for my demographic anymore. EA definitely wants the COD and Apex players and are competing for them. I'm 40 now, I have played every title in the series. I'll admit that the people they want buying this game don't give a shit about the ""feel"" of Battlefield and would appreciate being able to sprint-slide around the map."
"I don't want like Apex level movement, I'm 25 and was in high school for the golden age of BF and CoD, playing Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 & 4 tweaks like that aren't hard to fix either, so I wouldn't be shocked if running speed and stuff like that are fixed before launch, but I know why they made it faster, it was the expansion of the maps, if you were to take BF3 movement and put it on Orbital, shit would take FOREVER. So I can definitely see what they were doing, and in the final release I dont' forsee it being a massive issue."
Have you went back and played it? Maybe you jus need a refresher
I might give it a re-download and play it and compare.
"
I do not like it. Totally irrelevant sandbox feeling. Almost like Just Cause, only without a story and 5x worse. In addition, I dislike the minimum specs. Hardware prices stagnate or rise and a four year old 1600 Ryzen is no longer enough ??? For what?"
"The minimum specs are going to go down, but the gut feeling I guess I can't argue with that."
"I don't think they are, but I do think that the CPU specs are solely an effect of having 128 players in one server. Not to say it cant or wont be further optimized, warzone runs pretty smooth but does cap at around 110 fps due to CPU limitations. playing the smaller map and 64 players will probably still be fine for oldish CPUs'"
"The build of the game is (supposedly) 2 months old. This being said, they said they are working on further optimization. As a reference, over the development of Fortnite they tripled the frame rate for lower end systems."
"The destruction in this game is 100 steps back! Where is the building density and destruction, engineering class could easily be a useful class that rebuilds 4 walls and then the whole structure reappears and we can destroy it would actually be fun but this, this current state is not something i can get behind"
"Very poor performance on the PS5. BF5 played significantly better on previous gen hardware, than this does on the PS5. Shuttering and choppy movement are the norm. 
Definitely feels like this game could use a delay. Was excited to buy on day 1, but looks like I’ll be delaying my purchase."
"This is why you should game on a PC.

Edit: I subsist on your downvotes you fucking plebs"
It's rough on PC too. Both my laptop and desktop has stuttering issues at times
"Yeah it's just shitty optimization. It was a beta test, and the game version used for the beta was months old at that. If we were complaining about a live product, that's another thing
 I'll reserve my judgement and complaints until after launch, like a rational person."
"Cancelled my preorder as well, I’ll wait to Xmas when the game is half price like bfv was lol"
"All larger caliber bullets are useless. No suppression either. Battlefield is the last game i expected to make snipers, dmrs n lmgs useless and everone run around with ars and smgs. Like seriously lmgs shoot faster but do less damage to ""balance""? Their light machine guns and high caliber rifles!!!!  the game pisses me off. Just make the recoil higher and add suppression."
"Super disappointed with the beta. I was looking forward to this game and I'm going to wait to see if anything changes. A few thoughts:

Likes:
-WW2 is my favorite setting, but I like the return to modern after a few years of absence.

-I liked the customization on the go feature, although it is a bit odd in concept. It does make sense given the size of the maps and the need to change depending on the areas of the map. I would've much preferred a system where you can change load outs in a drop or an ammo fortification (like bf5).

Dislikes:

-The lack of classes is a big change and not one that I particularly enjoyed. Battlefield has always been about teamwork and the lack of classes and roles undermines teamwork. Revivals were rare.

-I hate the operators in the current format and would be okay with them with 2 changes: (1) if they stayed with the class system and (2) if each team had their own.

-I was okay with the changes to movement (i.e. grapple hook) in premise, but thought it was poorly executed in the game.

- The tornado /rocket was neat at first, but honestly, it's very gimmicky and I thought it was more annoying than enjoyable. I hope the other maps do not suffer from the same idea.  I thought levelution from bf4 was somewhat gimmicky, but it at least changed the dynamic of a map. The rocket is just there and the tornado is just annoying.

-Not a fan of the movement system. I wish they kept the system and the fortification system from"
"After what happened with BFV it absolutely amazes me they could have effed this up as bad as they seems like they have. They keep taking what should be a relatively easy proven formula, BF3/4 is the model, throwing it out the window and trying to make a new one.  I don't know what's going on with this company but changes need to be made."
"Honestly at this point, they should go back to BFV and create more maps cus its in a good state right now."
"Sorry man BFV stinks and nobody wants WWII anymore, how fickle the mass is because I heard the same things about how tired everyone was of modern shooters right before BF1 came out. 

Eh..they should remaster BF4/3 and add some maps and guns. Sell it for 20 or 30 bucks and it would fly. 

They're making it relatively obvious they aren't capable of making new game that's good so just give one that's already good with some updated graphics and some more content."
"I wouldn’t mind WWII if they did it right. Look at HELL LET LOOSE. It’s very popular. Sure not at AAA numbers, but it looks and feels like WWII. 

what ever DICE made was so sanitized and felt like it was for kids."
"I had fun. Definitely got a bit repetitive with only one map and one game mode, but I liked the gunplay & vehicle gameplay. Tornado was a nice ""surprise"" in matches, but obviously not completely game changing.

My main issue was the character models, i.e. not being able to tell friend from foe easily apart. Maybe I just suck, but I did shoot a my teammates a bunch of times in close quarters...

Anyway, since the core gameplay was great I have high hopes for this game. As a BF vet, I'm still mostly excited for Portal tbh."
">not being able to tell friend from foe easily apart. Maybe I just suck

No OP, you do not suck. **Glance Value** is a serious problem, if the UI were turned off, the game would be impossible to play."
"Yeah, they can have operators but they need to make a color pallet for them. 

If you have two Boris characters, the Russia team should have a different color tone from the US team. 

This would mean making new skins have a team specific indicator. 


OR, they could use other identifiers, fuck, give people a red arm band lol, if you play a hud removed or hardcore mode, playing is going to result in a ton of teamkills. 


This is my only gripe with the game."
"This might be a stupid question. (I played maybe ten matches) where was the tornado? Also, I only saw the spaceship launch once."
The tornado would spawn (from my experiences) either up by B or way down by C (I believe). I think one time it spawned by one of the HQs but I’m not sure. One of my matches the rocket launched when the tornado was right next to it. Instantly blew up lol
Wow! That’s pretty dang cool
Got the Tornado once. My sister and I hopped into a pickup truck. I drove straight at it. The Tornado picked us up and swirled us around then crashed us into the group. We agreed that was worth our death. 😂
"Can't remember how many matches I played, but probably more than 10 at least, and I got the tornado probably 4 times.

Which system did you play on? I've heard that old gen consoles might not have the feature (at least in beta)."
"I have a series x but played some games on the Xbox one version with friends who haven’t upgraded yet, both versions do have tornados/rocket launches. But the tornado looks way better on series x (obviously…)"
I played 10-15 on PC and caught the tail end of a tornado exactly one time
I play on PS4 and got the storm a few times. Just luck of the draw I guess.
"I played at least 10-15 rounds and only got 1 tornado, and 2 rocket launches. Tornado is impossible to miss and it appears on the deploy screen as well. It was so fun that one round it did decide to show up."
the core gameplay is wrecked because of those specialists though. If they won't do anything about it the teamwork will be dead
"I wasn’t really following news on the game. After BFV I refused to preorder it (I’ve preordered BF games since 3). The specialists were a surprise and more or less made me question if I’ll even buy this battlefield. It’s just like Firestorm, a half-baked attempt at something nobody wanted and other games do better. 

At the end of the day it’s probably a way to help them make money. Which honestly I don’t mind at all. More money roughly equals better game, but there are other ways to push micro transactions than this gimmicky trash. I think it definitely disrupts squad mechanics, it’s not even really original, and it kills the sense of being an anonymous grunt in an epic battle."
You’d think that more money = better game but we’ve now bad 2 battlefields in a row that missed the mark pretty bad with their practically infinite money pool being an EA studio.
I edited in “roughly” to that statement because I knew someone would more or less say this lol.
You literally played a months old build beta and are calling it half baked 😂
"It doesn’t matter where they are in production, it’s still unoriginal, gimmicky, and an attempt to inject mechanics and content that i don’t think really work with the gameplay that makes BF unique. This is definitely a subjective view, but I really don’t think I’m on an island saying this."
You don’t think it matters where they are in their cycle to call it half baked?  That’s…..an interesting perspective
It's the build they showcased. It's their own fault.
I guess we will see
"If they only add one more equiptment slot, they could 100% lock operators and ""teamwork gadgets"" into their own slots and have a third, free slot for tbe explosives and whatnot. 

It doesnt seem like there are enough weapons to split into classes though, so that's never going to change, and I really dont know if DICE would be willing to add better UI to show potential medic/ammo guys"
"There's supposedly nearly a hundred legacy weapons coming with Battlefield Portal, just pepper those into the 2042 mode."
"Im pretty sure we'll be able to sift weapons into the bf3/bc2 class setup, so if that side of 2042 isnt bugged to shit, we may have our solution to the operator system right there."
The beta didn’t have all the weapons in it
"the discussion is always thrown off by these hot takes, try not dealing in absolutes like a Anakin. I'm worried about the specialists too but nothing is WRECKED or DEAD and they will probably tune this in to start making more sense."
"He's not wrong though: Team play is discouraged/""dead"" due to the nature of being able to ""all-class."" Granted, this was a ""beta"" (more like a demo with bugs), but the amount of ammoboxes and healthboxes equipped and thrown I can count on *one hand*. That is **very discouraging** for team-play.

&#x200B;

Maybe it'll change around with launch/post-game support, but I'm dubious given how selfish the Battlefield community can be in general. If *DICE THEMSELVES* aren't encouraging it with the kit load-outs and separating the items, *how* would you encourage it? Double-so when you can only equip *one* all-class item. You can't be full-support (ammo/health double-equipped) at the expense of something else (rocket/AA launcher, armor equipped for better damage mitigation). It's baffling how DICE continues to discourage team-play when Hardline had it right with the ""steal health/ammo"" system on classes AND you at least were guaranteed to find someone with those thanks to the four-class system.

&#x200B;

Is that a better ""absolute"" discussion for you?"
"Don't forget some man are Desmond Doss reincarnated, or a dedicated ammo station."
I mean the game really could have used some sort of tutorial or something. More people would probably engage.
"The amount of ammo boxes thrown in BF V was also so low that they patched in the option to walk up to a blueberry and grab ammo.

Let's face it, real team play is dead no matter the game. R6 feels like 1v5 in solo same as CS:GO and Overwatch even has a meme of the matchmaker on the front page.

Making BF less team play reliant is surely unpopular here, but I have to say I welcome it. I don't have a large stack anymore, we're 2-3 guys most of the time. So not having to rely on some noob to join my squad and actually be helpful is a net positive for me."
This issue is that what they've done is made it nearly impossible for random teams to be useful to their squad mates because you can't even tell who has ammo etc. It's beyond the question of potential 9f a random noob being useful. They've neutered everyone equally with these changes.
"It’s equally as plausible to say that because the ability to “all class” is meant to encourage team play, as the potential users of ammo and health is far larger now. 

We know most people aren’t going to use those items, but they traditionally were risky picks anyways. 

The people who play as medics and supports have always been limited in supply.

It feels like this is more projection than anything. People are thinking “I’m not going to use that class, or switch to it, so teamplay is dead!”


Like, I dunno, if you want that aspect, use the ammo and health packs and make that difference. 

It’s also been said before that being able to all class meant everyone would just use ammo boxes for their own ammo pool. 

At the end of the day, from what I remember in almost every battlefield game, I had to switch classes constantly. Suicide and redeploy as what was needed. Because teamplay has always been shit in battlefield unless you played with friends and joined community servers where lots of clan players played"
Thank you for being one of the only sane people here. The only team play that ever happened was someone running out of ammo so they dropped an ammo box for themself and someone else happened to go use it. Just because there’s an ammo box class doesn’t change people from being selfish. The main source of team play is attacking an objective together which STILL happened in this beta. Storming through the tunnel between D was a blast. Attacking B’s tower was tough but rewarding if you took it over. People are overreacting.
"Absolutely. 

Was the beta rough? Absolutely, but the difference between it and the alpha was pretty stark, if we get even half the fidelity increase and polish in the release version from this beta, as we did Fromm the alpha to this beta, we will be in good shape. 

Am I worried about some aspects? Absolutely. I don’t like how operators look the same, either they need to have an overlay that makes enemies look different, or they nationalize the teams into a different color scheme to some degree, but having it identical puts any thought of a hardcore server to death. You simply won’t be able to tell your team apart. 

Or the movement and vehicle controls. These rarely change from beta to launch. I hope they get tightened up and overall smoothed out a bit. 

Vehicle desync where vehicles farther away look like they are unaffected by gravity or physics, again, I hope is corrected. 


But am I concerned about any of the major complaints I e been seeing posted here, like “teamplay”? Fuck no. All these people have complaints rooted in boomer logic and are completely parallel to the rhetoric when 3, 1, and V came out. 

The cognitive dissonance is unreal, to the point where we get people trying to rationalize their dislike as by saying it’s catering to the “new generation” despite people like myself, who has played hundreds if not thousands of hours in each title since 1942. 

People don’t seem to realize they can still enjoy stuff if it isn’t perfectly built to their standards, but get hung up, and externalize those disapproval’s, projecting them onto other people. Which is a super healthy and not at all toxic way of dealing with feelings /s. 

2 -3 years from now we will get battlefield 2022 which will be a historical piece about the war between the antivax, the insurectionists, and the rest, and people will compare it to 2042 seemingly ignoring or forgetting their complaints  and putting 2042 on an impossible pedestal."
"No, because teamwork never existed in BF to begin with. It’s a first person shooter. People pick medic for the guns and ability to self heal. Medics who res are awesome and I’m one of them because I genuinely do find it to be a fun mini game but it’s not any less encouraged than it was in BF4. The animation is a little clunky and could be sped up but overall the classes are fine. The only issue with the specialists is the visual issue of not knowing which team is which due to the lack of team-restricted specialists. CoD vanguard is doing the same thing for some fucking reason. Apparently making it impossible to know who to shoot is the current industry fad. Hell, even Halo is doing it. It’s bizarre."
Have you actually played BF?
Yeah and if you disagree with my comment you are absolutely stupefied by nostalgia. It's really fucking dumb to pretend old games are better than they actually are just to shit on a new game.
"I have been playing since BF1942 and you’re right, nostalgia is a big part of it for me but that has no part in my dislike of specialists and preference for classes. It’s just poorly implemented. I don’t even get why they didn’t keep the BFV setup. You have your classes but then you’ve got customisation options for appearance. Could even buy skins if you’re so inclined. Add in unlocked primary weapons and it should be fine 

Also people say how primary weapons locked to classes is stupid but that’s how it is irl too. Not every soldier has an LMG. Not every soldier has an M203 launcher. Not every soldier carries a scoped rifle. You don’t get to pick what weapon you carry whenever you want. Everyone has their role to play. BF may not be realistic but it has elements of realism in its portrayal of military and combat and I think it should stick to that because it does it well."
"I like primaries not being locked to classes because I like to run different setups but I also really like playing as a medic. I have always hated that in order to be a medic I have to run a specific weapon type. It's boring and hurts the variety of gameplay. I think gadgets should be locked to classes instead of specialists, though. It makes no sense to allow people to run Falck and an ammo crate for literally infinite ammo and health the entire game. There needs to be a balance at some point or there is no longer a point for team work. In that regard I understand the ""BF2042 discourages teamwork"" argument 100%. I just don't think it's fair to the game to act like anyone cared when it did encourage teamwork."
"I agree with you on the team play aspect. It worries me as well, and I'm hoping that DICE sees these things and tunes stuff to be more class oriented - maybe add the ability to have repair tool and rocket launcher. What I mean is that it's dealing in absolutes saying everything is FUCKED and unplayable and literally call of duty now. I'm hoping they see the need to work some more on the specialists to make them more class-like in ""all out warfare"" or conquest gamemodes. 

Seriously, throw in another slot of equipment and limit boris to the engineer class, something like that. Maybe hazard zone could then be less team oriented like it is now. I don't know, but to me it doesn't seem dead or fucked or literally ruined. It just needs tweaking, and not in the ""overhaul gameplay"" way."
Well my thing is why would I run med bag/ammo bag when I can only use it once per life? Why the heck is that even a thing it basically means you have to be strategically aware at all times when to deploy it.
">I'm worried about the specialists too but nothing is WRECKED or DEAD and they will probably tune this in to start making more sense.

I don't believe that for a minute that they'll tweak it any time soon. They have a long track record of not making any major changes before the launch of a game and if any changes are made at all it will be LONG after launch."
">they will probably tune this in to start making more sense.

i'm not betting $100 AUD on that. remove specialists immediately."
"It's not a hot take, it is objective fact that the direction they're taking will ruin teamwork generally speaking."
"To me it just felt like classes with new names/named characters. I basically played medic and assault in all matches.

My main issue that both teams look the same."
"This is the crux of it, people somehow think everyone having the option to use medkits and ammo, means teamplay is dead. 


Because THEY never use those classes traditionally. People who play those classes, will continue to do so, like they always have. 

Classic battlefield moment - if my team needs X, I have to change to X because looks like no one else is doing it. Except these dudes refuse because they want to just do what they want to do. 

It’s not teamplay if it doesn’t benefit *them*"
"yup, thats why I like that everybody has access to pretty much everything, less of reliance on randoms knowing what class to chose."
"I honestly wonder how bad it's really going to be at launch with more specialists available and also cosmetics starting to unlock. Hopefully it helps the everyone being the same issue from the beta. 

You know for sure this is how they are discussing it in the studio.  They only had 4 specialists after all. 

I still think they need to color themes for the teams though like 100%. I think that will be one of the main things driving how long I play this game."
"Problem is that you can create builds like self healing sniper with ammo crate, or spiderman with assault rifle and rocket launcher. They're just so powerful, they don't need teamwork. And it was only beta, with like 10% of full content, it will be a mess in a few months after release, when people will discover meta builds."
"Definitely agreed one the teams looking the same.

But I also agree with you about the classes. Everyone's freaking out about Specialists but it's literally just the Assault/Medic/Engineer/Recon dynamic but renamed. I played the classes pretty much the same way I always did."
"I disagree, at least with my group I was playing with it was working pretty great. I can see how just playing solo with a bunch of other randoms can make that less apparent but it was kinda just the same in previous BF titles.. 

Playing objectives and using different classes in squads has always been an issue"
"People said that about the class change with assault having the healing abilities on 4. 

People said that about being able to use any gun in bc2.

People said it about being able to pickpocket ammo and health off people in V.

People said it about squad spawns, and buddy revives. And self repair, and so on and so forth. 

“No team play” has been a universal complaint over minor gameplay changes that didn’t actually change anything because a significant playerbase of shooters have always just been in it to rack up kills and pad their stats.


Here’s the truth- battlefield has always had trouble with team play. You had to force team play if you wanted it. And by that I mean, you literally had to try. This meant playing with friends, and being in clans, and joining specific servers. You could use game chat to muster up a band of apes sometimes, but it was still not common even with the SL chat and commander chat in bf2. Not in random servers anyways. 

You want that level of immersion, you need to play with friends and make it happen."
"> If they won't do anything about it the teamwork will be dead

Teamwork has been dead in BF for over a decade, it's time to stop beating that dead horse while screaming that you're doing it to make sure it doesn't actually die. Ever since BC1, the franchise has been moving farther and farther away from having teamwork be necessary for winning or staying alive.

There's a reason 80% or more of the community doesn't work together and just runs from flag to flag looking to farm kills; because they're not remotely punished for doing that, in fact, the changes to the gameplay with each installment only made lone-wolfing it in BF more and more viable.

And we're never going to be able to ""course correct"" the IP back to being what it was prior to the Frostbite engine because the average player doesn't want to have to rely on their teammates to do well; they just want to be able to jump in the game, turn off their brain, and enjoy themselves. It's exactly why every tactical element of these games gets bitched about to no end until they get rebalanced to the point where a single player can counter just about anything they run into.

Why run the Engineer kit on a vehicle heavy map if you can equip AT weapons to any of the kits and net kills by bumrushing tanks with a handful of C4 or harassing them from range with mortars or SUAVs?"
"Exactly. I really hope the way the operators are handled right now is just a placeholder and there will be team specific people. 

Other than that and some bugs and lags the gameplay was fun. 

And I seriously don't know why people say it doesn't feel like the battlefield experience. There was chaos and things going on everywhere. Plans rushing above you helicopter chasing trucks and crashing left and right. Tactical elements with the boys circling around capping a point on the side. 

So for me it felt pretty great.

Also the weapons feel ok. Nothing like they are all laser beams or such. At least pc they had quite the recoil...."
Specialists won't be team specific so people can use their Kawaiii MTX skins whenever they want.
Well if nothing changes then we're fkd.
"Yeah I agree with you. I really enjoyed playing the beta, the TTK is just perfect, and I also liked the gunplay. Most of the problems is the horrible hud and UI, you can't see someone requesting ammo or medipack, but I think that can be adjusted by the implementation of the classic rose. They have to put back the kill log on the left, the point on the central bottom, and also the scorebord with ping.

I was doubtful on specialist, but in some way they works.

I liked the vehicles, maybe the little bird are a little to op, I think that they have to increase the recharging time of the missiles.

The squad should be bigger, I would increase up to 8.

Overall the gameplay is fine, the main concern is the differentiation between enemy and allies."
Really? I thought the ttk was just a hair too fast.
"Same exact sentiments, bf4 tag not coincidental"
"Exactly :) In bf1 and bfv we lost the sandbox experience that was present before, they where good games but not funny very different from bf4, this is battlefield, abd this is why I like bf2042."
The only way specialists work is to make more profit for EA
The specialists do not work........
"yes,totaly agree"
"Glad to see this is the top comment. I had a blast playing and agree with your criticisms. I’d add that I hope the devs can tweak it in ways that improve teamwork. Improve the revive mechanic, more health/ammo dropped, etc. Otherwise, I’m very excited for the full release!"
"I had enough time for one round and the same character models was an immediate issue especially in close quarters (don’t recall if there’s an enemy indicator when sniping).

Also add long walk / travel time from spawn at game start, needed some boats / APCs to help.

Otherwise am looking forward to launch"
"Oh wow, an actual reasonable review. As a BF vet I’ve seen way way way worse launches/Beta."
"I played about 26.7 hours, and while I found myself enjoying the game and wondering what would be added for Full release, I have some serious concerns about some features and choices which may affect games longevity.

1. Player Movement - HORRID, The Player movement really disappointed me. This movement feels like a copy paste of COD or APEX, which is not a good thing. The A/D Strafing is super silly and aggravating and Players are zipping around way too fast and sliding like they have dipped themselves in a 52 gallons of Lube. I hate how arcade the movement has become lets go back to compared to BF1 or BF3. 

1. Sound Engine - I won't really get too deep into this because it's only a Beta, however the Sound Engine feels lacking, especially when you compare it to other Battlefield Titles and even Battlefront titles. I'm really wondering if the Vehicle sounds are place holders because they don't shake the soul right now like they used to. BF1 & BFV the plane and tank sound felt so good as they reverberated through the body especially at close range. Right now with the current beta build I can't even hear a tank roll up on me when nothing is really happening around me which is very very very very sad and disappointing. The key feedback parts of the game like am I safe can I hear anything moving around me is completely gone. Finally, WORST of all the footsteps are gone!!! I miss the BF1 sound and BF4 sound where I could move around the map and secure points based on the sound of what's happening around me. 

1. HUD Design - I like the simplicity of the HUD design and I'm sure the Beta does not have the final polished version. However I would like to point out some areas of frustration I have had over the past few days. I can not see Sector D1 & D2 separately, or the status of either flag. In BF5 you could see the Status of a flag with a glance and see if the enemy is attacking, or if you need to reinforce it. I find myself not knowing the Objective status and I'm constantly trying to see the flag status and failing. 
The Flag status should be displayed predominantly when looking at the site. I would love to see it get back to the point where I just take a quick look at a flag and know exactly the status. I believe this is in the current BETA build however the minimap does not do enough to pronounce it. The Capture area for a flag should be more prominent to show the control area for a single flag? It would be great to know the area that is responsible for capping a single flag without memorizing it. The sector mapping is great and all but provides me with no important details at all. Weapon Fire Mode - Why can I not see the fire mode until I ADS? This should be moved especially since V & B & C keys are very close together.
Map View - I assume this is busted for the beta because I believe the Key bind is M, however an enlarged map view should be easily accessible. 
I found the players in this beta to fail miserably to work together to take objectives and points and to do basic BF things like provide Ammo, Heals, Revives. I think that's due to the lack of a Squad system (which as mentioned above should come in later) but also due to the fact that Medics don't get the clear revive counter like in BF5 which was a great feature. I think the Hud needs some sharpness added.  I also believe that we need indicators for I NEED AMMO or I NEED HEALS. 

1. Gunplay - Gun Balance is a mess. The M5 is just a god, LMG is basically a peashooter and snipers feel terrible and numb. I'm sure the Dev team knows what's going on and will help to solve some of the issues as we move forward. 

1. Squad Menu/Controls -  I believe this missing feature was addressed by Devs however I will voice my OPINION. YOU CAN NOT HAVE A BATTLEFIELD WHERE THE SQUAD MENU IS MISSING. 

1. Text Chat - Was the Text chat disabled? I want to be able to at least text people in the lobby questions or talk outside of my squad. 

1. Vehicle Balance - Tanks felt Pretty decent maybe light on Damage. They might move a bit too slowly. The Turret bug should be fixed by launch I hope. This will be an unpopular opinion but I think Choppers are a bit strong especially with a pilot who isnt dumb. I had a few games of 40+ kills in a chopper without much challenge. Choppers felt like typical BF. I think Choppers need a bit of a relook. 

1.  Missing Old BF Features - Why have we given up on a lot of the old concepts from BF4, BF5 & BF1? It feels like we have officially gone backwards instead of moving to the ""NEXT GENERATION OF BF"". Other battlefields had more features imo then currently within this beta. Ammo/Health Crates around the map like in BF5. Building system to fortify area's post destruction. Picking ammo off other players because no one i was dropping them at all. Kit switching to drop what you need instead of just picking up guns. All of these are good examples of stuff that made the games better. 

1. Revive System - Buggy Mess and basically useless. Revive Animation is buggy and messy. But that I'm sure will be fixed. Medics seem like they are sitting ducks, leading to not a lot of revives. I think the current system needs a relook. I agree the original Medic system with the Revival Gun was a bit OP however the current Medic is too weak. 

1. Specialists - I was slightly concerned about the change from Classes to Specialists. I was partly behind the choice to allow all weapons to be used by any operator as long as it was balanced. What I'm finding is I really miss kit swapping to throw down ammo or meds or using enemy kit to get an advantage or grab a rocket launcher. The loss of this play style is a HUGE loss for the franchise in my opinion. On a separate note why can i not save loadouts or classes i haven't used in a round. It would be good to have a preset for when you load into a hot zone and not have to deal with weapon attachments being blank. 

1. Medic Specialist - Medic's need work. I have not seen an abundance of Medical Packs or boxes on the field at any time, which I view as an issue. Same can be said about ammo boxes. Healing Pistol is CRAP! Trying to hit targets was hit or miss especially with people running around like crazy drugged out maniacs. I liked the original system where you could throw medic pouches to teammates requesting heals and see the squads and teams health bars. New Medic is not fun or useful to play imo. Self Heal Takes way too long to administer. It should be a double tap on 3 or something else besides a hold. Charge timer should  be less than half of the current charge. If you believe the timer is good then it should be an instant 100% health heal. Reviving Squad/teammates in the current build is very very risky as such i believe it needs to be looked at. Revival System is similar to BF5 which requires an animation which I personally think is Ok however the medic class in beta has no ability to cover or conceal the use of the defeb. I also think the revive timer might be way too long.

1. Grapple Dude - Very fun and awesome Operator. Does he have a place in BF….NO. But hey, makes for fun gameplay. This character only adds some annoying movement to the game. I like being able to get on buildings and move quickly by grappling ground to reposition but couple this guy with the shit sound engine and I just find it hurting the game in the long run.  We gave all the people who don't Play the objective or support the squad a perfect character to use .

1. Turret Dude -  I found myself playing this guy the most. I really found him to be a lot of fun.  Turret is really weak for damage but those wall hacks are really very strong especially when pushing through forest or wooded areas. 

1. Sniper dude  - Really does well to blend into the bushes and not be seen ever. Annoying.  Ability is absolutely useless. 

1. Attachment Swap System - I love the gear attachment change system. I wish it was more of a tactical thing vs an arcade just magically changing stuff. It should take longer to change attachments like optics and barrel attachments. This should not be something you can do mid fight. I also think it would be cool if some attachments are only available at controlled sectors resupply points. Ya know if you ever add resupply points like in BF5 which was a good feature. 

1. Character Models - I assume this must be a placeholder - NO WAY DO WE ALL LOOK THE SAME. The damn BOTS have different specialists/skins. I get Skin = $$$ but i can not accept friendly and enemy look, sound, talk the same. We need to do something to help keep them separate. I miss having two different looking teams so I can keep things straight. The amount of times teammates are shooting at each other is two damn high. 

1. Increased Player Count should mean increased squad size, maybe increase to a Platoon based fight. An 8 players per squad system might allow us to be better at taking objectives and working together.




TL;DR - All in all, this BF2042 feels like the foundation is available for an EPIC EXPERIENCE however right now it feels more like it doesn't have an identity! A weird mishmash, stuck Halfway between Battlefield and COD. It does not feel like a Battlefield Title. As i said before my top 2 concerns  are as follows can get addressed to help make a better game in my opinion:

* Movement - Too arcade, too fast! 
* Sound Engine - Needs to be more in depth. Footsteps need to come back."
The lack of things from BFV is kind of odd. Like I get that it wasn’t super popular but they tossed out literally everything it introduced.
"I totally agree! Hence why I wonder how much was left out of the beta build. They could be testing something very specific like in the BF5 Tech Tests. However, Dice does seem to do this though where nice features just get dropped or cool mechanics are changed. I'm just surprised at how drastically we have gone away from the core battlefield game style to this  APEX Legends or COD gameplay. For a ""Love Letter to BF Fans"" this seems more like a letter to Apex and Cod player to check out BF."
"I laugh when I hear that BF2042 is a ""love letter to BF fans"".

Yeah, like a used condom in the mail. Thanks DICE."
"I think they aimed this BF game for those COD kids... ""only run and shoot without thinking too much""...  


THIS IS NOT BATTLEFIELD!  
Refunded with success!"
"This game needs another delay.

The game lacks depth and it runs horribly.

Specialists instead of normal classes was a BIG mistake"
"For my two cents, it was a lot of dumb fun. Feels nothing like Battlefield. I enjoyed my time but nothing about this makes me want to buy the game."
"After thinking about it for a while, the game didn't ""feel"" like battlefield. At least not the battlefield I've poured thousands of hours into over the years. I'll still give the game a fair shake I suppose, but probably wait for a sale or something. The beta was underwhelming to say the least."
"This. I refunded, going back to BF4."
"I was hyped for the game before, but now after playing it, I dont think I will be buying it.  
  
The game doesnt look as good as I expected. I feel like both BF1 and BF5 looked better. 
  
The general gameplay feels like a knock of battlefield game. Especially the running animation, its honestly feels like a cheap steam f2p battlefield clone.  
  
And the biggest issue of all. I didnt expect it to run well, but my god was it bad. BF4 had an absolute awful beta that barely ran, but somehow this managed to be worse than that.   
  
  
To me the game feels both unfinished and also poorly made. I will wait for a year and check it out again, but a release purchase is a no from me."
"I was not impressed, I expected gunplay similar to bf4 and was excited for it. Instead I get a modern warfare cod/apex type mix of a game. WTF is this? I already played the hell out of modern warfare and apex a bit to. Why the fuck do I want to replay the same fucking ""feel"" again? I seriously am considering a refund. I was highly disappointed with the beta. Why not have regular bf4 TTK and hardcore modes? Instead they decided to copy modern warfare COD and have one fairly fast TTK. Being sniped in open maps took 2 shots to kill and 1 to the head (in bf4), now its just fucking one shot to kill in bf2042. I am just disappointed and my hype was killed. Another thing, the beta had mad shuttering with cpu fps being red all the time (3080ti and 8700k)"
"Took me 3-4 shots to kill someone from distance in the body with sniper and really irritated me. However, ttk on the assault rifles at distance was even fast lol. Btw with 8700k and 3080ti you’re cpu bottlenecked, could be the reason for the stutters other than it being in beta."
I have read people with 10900k's and up also getting stuttering though.
"5900X here, stuttered as fuck."
"Yeah I have a 5950x, 32gb ram, 3080.   It still studdered.   What was weird,  it wasn't the normal PC lag.  It was like glitched out bullshit.  Like I'd see the world disappear, then the game would freeze up for a second.

Also, the whole feel of the game was off.  Once I headshot a guy,  he walked around for a few seconds,  then it said I killed him.   Uhh is this real life or something? lol"
"3930k with A 3070, my experience was pretty good to be honest"
"An 8700k is not a fucking bottleneck, lmfao. 

It's shitty optimization. God damn."
Paired with a 3080Ti you’re bottlenecked yes around 7%
"No he isn't. 8700K/3090 here. Game never even went above 90% CPU utilization.

Games like BF aren't ever really that CPU hungry. They have always been GPU intensive."
"That’s not how it works…you’re assuming the frostbite engine can use your hardware 100% efficiently. Not many games can, if any, which is why it’s calculated synthetically."
Frostbite has always been a GPU hogger. From the very first iteration of it.
"Cool- and there's no fucking way that it's churning through the maximum memory pipeline bandwidth provided by that chip, either, which is the only forseeable bottleneck coming from.a CPU paired with a high end GPU these days."
Agreed
Did a fantastic job of convincing me not to buy or expect anything of this game
"Cancelled my pre-order today. I've heard the "" its an older build"" line too many times. The Halo Infinite team said the same thing about the gameplay trailer last year, then they delayed after realizing it wouldn't fly for very long.  


2042 looks phenomenal *in theory*, but top to bottom everything needs a lot of improvement (sans the map, because I just loved that)  


The audio seems to neglect to play sometimes, with weapons and vehicles and explosions often being silent, and the soundscape in general is just muted. You can be at D in the center of the map and it can be overall a very quiet and peaceful because the distant sounds are super quiet.  

The gunplay felt decent but seemed to be missing *something* imo. A lot of the guns felt like they were lacking punch, but it could be the missing sounds. 
The attachment system is interesting but barely functioning. I routinely had to reapply the attachments every respawn and variable-zoom scopes would need to be removed and replaced every now and again since they would stop working altogether.  

The destruction has been greatly reduced. Full buildings cant be destroyed anymore, just the walls.  

Vehicles seem to hate existence, often glitching themselves, the people inside them, and people who look at them. Teleporting jets was a norm, stop motion tanks was a staple.  

The specialists.... either scrap the full system or if you really want to leech money off us with hero characters just like call of duty does, at the very least **make them bound to classes**. This whole system destroys the squad mechanic and if you're going to go with the current system you may as well remove squads too because they are nothing but low functioning respawn points now.  Additionally, make them bound to factions. Everyone being the same is obnoxious and lowkey game breaking since your new responses to seeing another human *has to be* ""shoot first, ask questions later.""

The UI is hilarious. It somehow has too much and too little information. The giant banner telling me who has zone advantage is redundant because I would otherwise be able to figure it out by seeing who has what zones on the other parts of the UI. Or the map I couldnt see. Yet at the same time I have no idea who in my squad is running ammo or meds or anti-tank because the UI tells me nothing about their loadouts with the *new sucky specialist system*  

This isn't something specific but a combo of all the previous. Its baffling how we have double the people but the game generally feels quieter. The battlefield doesn't seem to be the same amount of chaos. Somehow everything seems *less* despite being doubled. Maybe thats just me idk.  

I did not list the extremely long list of minor bugs because this post would be probably triple the size. There are compilations out there, Skill-up on youtube did a review and covered most of the bugs I experienced.

Anywho, I will probably buy this a month or so after launch. I will see what they managed fix and make my judgment based on that. As of right now, it would be a great misuse of my money to pre-order this mess. I hope it turns around because I would love to have Battlefield back after the joke that was 5."
"5 got much better after pacific, but it was bad at launch, we have been with this ""launch it broken and than try to fix it"" in every installment since BF3, some better, some worse, I'll just wait for a sale, it is certainly not worth the $70 (R$ 338,90 where I live), and until then I'm sure the game will play a lot better, with much less bugs and broken mechanics, I'll end up paying less for a better product."
"Good to know, I did not make it that far. 5 was by far my least play time in any Battlefield since I started playing ages ago. It would be nice to have a BF launch in a decent state for once rather than be good once the next ones about to come out."
"I’m really enjoying 5. It feels like an action movie. The squad based gameplay is the best so far too. I think bf5 really hits everything on your list very well, idk maybe I’m just a sucker 😅 but to me it seems pretty well fleshed out"
"Battlefield V is really good imo. Kinda sucks EA/DICE kinda tried to murder their reputation when it launched, but it definitely finished in a much better place. I have been playing it a lot after the bf2042 beta. It certainly feels a heck of a lot more like a battlefield game than 2042 did in the beta at any point."
[已移除]
Guns definitely feel weightless. Explosions have SOME weight..
"There are no classes in game now. The *Class*-kits are just “recommended” loadout presets that *named* after legacy classes, nothing more. Saves newbies a few clicks and that’s all."
"It's abysmal honestly. I hate feeling like I'm outright hating on the game, but it just wasn't good. I was..okay with it, until I played BF4 for the first time in a couple of weeks & BF1 for the first time in over a year to compare. 8 & 5 year old games were so exponentially better it's laughable.

And you know, you just know the reason they're pushing these 'specialist' systems is for monetisation through gun & player skin micro transactions.

Feels like the core of Battlefield has been ripped out."
"I dont know if this will be heard but, if you have had any precsence on the subreddit over the last few days you will know that people really strongly dislike the ""hero/operator"" system, I know these things usually aren't changed from community feedback but for the love of God retcon it, it might save the game

I think we'd pretty much all universally rather have unnamed soldiers with kits instead of named characters, you can reuse the voices just remove the named characters."
I second this
Character-specifics skins are essential to their microtransaction plans. They'll remove guns from the game before they sabotage their monetization schemes.
"Thats what I feared, but I think alot of people would still rather buy equipment for unnamed soldiers..."
"If it was some free to play game being offered by an indie studio I might simply ignore it as generic but forgiveable. As a battlefield game its an absolute failure. Characters move with no regard for inertia or momentum, everyone's on ice skates. Player scale is ludicrous, everyones a dwarf in a normal sized world in this game. The specialist system is the crown jewel atop the shit kingdom that is 2042, the need to make money  off of this fad means we get a team of Jake Gyllenhaals swarming us while we try and kill the friendly Jake Gyllenhaal that just came up the stairs behind us. Its the reason we get 3rd person melee kills and abandoned the class system it is perhaps the worst decision im the franchises history and fuck EA and Dice for spoiling such a great series with it."
"Sniping is the worst it’s even been across all Battlefield titles by an enormous degree. It is actually impossible to land headshots on console for a number of reasons.

- The character model are shrunken and look half the size at 100m compared to previous Battlefield games
- The bullet speed & drop is too slow
- Characters movement is WAY to fast and erratic, making it so much harder to lead headshots. Just look at some of the clips posted in this forum of people missing a full mag of assault rifle up close, then emptying a pistol mag or two at each other, then giving up and going their separate ways, all the while they are moving around the screen like grasshopper that’s just racked a line of Tabasco. It feels the opposite of what battlefield combat should be, and it looks so unimmersive to witness gunfights like equilibrium except everyone misses.
- Enemies can just strafe and shoot back with assault rifle spray at lightning speed, and accuracy with no penalty to aim just strafing around erratically. I felt like I was throwing BBs at a fly, trying to land a headshot. If I did get a headshot (almost never) it felt like luck more than skill. I actually put my controller down and uninstalled the beta after I reached my limit with this, it’s so bad.
- Enemies can just slide around with no penalties, and able to bring up their weapon immediately after a slide like cod or titan fall.
- because you don’t need to be still when trying to burst fire a gun at range for better accuracy, there are often no targets to shoot at that aren’t just sliding or strafing around at Mach 5. Usually you could find other unaware enemies that had stopped to shoot, and headshot them, but not in 2042.
No stationary turrets or rocket launchers also means there is less easy targets to shoot at. No bipods players either.
- Headshots with a sniper should prevent a revive, but they don’t.
- Super sprint makes these problems even worse. And leading headshots is more erratic because there are multiple sprint speeds.
- Pistols seem so drastically outclassed by full auto weapons at close range compared to bf4. If you come across a good player of the same skill level, you actually stand no chance unless they make a very large mistake. It’s not fun.
- terrain is so shell pocked and just generally uneven that you can’t lead headshots with any real consistency.

Sniping is not fun in this game. I will cancel my preorder and will skip this game if it stays the same, I’m really gutted was really looking forward to this game. On top of all the other issues, I feel this game has made many severe mistakes about core game design, balance, and the battlefield identity feels scooped out of the game with all the Woody macaques running around and no classes etc. I hope this can be fixed but I’m unsure it will"
"Amen! 

A bullet leaves the barrel of a sniper rifle at 7-800 meters pr second.

Yet in this BF it feels like you’re throwing snowballs whenever you aim at a target 100-150 meters away (through a broken “4X” scope) and count the seconds as the bullet slooowly arches it’s way towards the target.

Was sniping too easy in BFV? I don’t know. Maybe. Some people seem to think so. 

But this is massively going in the completely opposite direction. 

Yes you need skill as a sniper and remember the bulletdrop when you’re aiming at someone on the other side of the map. Not when the person is like 150 meters away."
"UI needs a LOT of work. Weapon customization is hopefully on par with BF4. If the plus system is all we are going to get, then that is very disappointing."
"The UI needs an overhaul, but that can be fixed. My main issue is that I just didn't find the game to be fun lol."
Leads over at Dice already pulling out the mean criticism card. Do not listen to the devs who say that stupid shit thats the same thing Blizzard said for years. You can give 5 years straight of perfect theory crafting on why a class was bad in WoW and they never listened. What fixed things in a shit game? Outrage and it always works.
"lol! Got a link?

I love their: “Don’t worry guys! This beta is an oooooold build! Everything is waaay better now!”

ORLY?!

Then why would you choose an old, buggy build to showcase the game?!

When a DICE dev goes on a dating app, does he upload the pic where weighs 400lb but writes: “BTW that’s an old pic, I lost all that weight and an super buff today!”?"
"Remember when they had the smooth brain idea to tell everyone who didn't like them trying to change history to not buy BFV?

They then built an entire wall of quotes for the launch, and it either was shown or was leaked?

Yeah because insulting you're customers worked out so well!"
I really hope that they offer more varied and “legacy” air vehicle controls.
Confused on why they would end the beta early Sunday and not Sunday night
"Still don't have a clue why they wouldn't run it through Sunday night instead of through Saturday, though I guess the player population might taper off after Sat night?"
After an 78 hour work week I finally got a chance to jump on and play with my little brother we got in a cool two games and had fun and on the 3rd we got kicked out and ended up playing splitgate. I wish they would’ve done it until Sunday night/Monday morning
"It was not in BFV but it was in BF1 and that is....

&#x200B;

In settings under GAMEPLAY>WORLD ICONS

&#x200B;

Here you could set up the opacity for just about everything in game. From when your not ADS to when you ADS.

&#x200B;

I hope they do not leave this out of BF2042 as there is so much screen clutter I want to dim or get rid of especially the downed but not out teammates that need revives. They are so big and in the way!!"
"If spotting is going to be implemented it needs to be fixed. and where is the interaction wheel with callouts?  


I liked BF4 spotting but it was too easy to use as a ""scanner"". If instead you automatically spotted enemies after aiming at them for 3 seconds or something and spot only lasted as long as you were looking.  


The soldier to soldier TTK is fine (sort of) I think I'll enjoy Hardcore more.  
The TTK from a mounted weapon is atrocious. Make it inaccurate or something but make it hurt. Coax lmg on tank was weaker than a paintball gun. Could only be used to annoy enemies. Had to use the main gun on soldiers as it reloaded faster than the machinegun killed."
"The minigun on the Hind felt like an airsoft gun. I knew I hit the guy, I **saw** I hit the guy and yet, nothing."
Do you think there will actually be any hardcore modes without a way to tell the teams apart? They probably won't even include it.
pretty sure they'll work it out.
"Lagging on a 3090 with i9, massacred by helicopter pilots with no recourse (even with rockets and ap, they can just fly away, heal up, and come back later.) Gonna wait for it to go on sale and then wait even more for it to get updated.

Super bland and basic, missing core bf features that ie expected such as destruction, suppressing fire, etc. Can't even ask for ammo or communicate with teammates, no incentive to stay with your squad. Hopefully just outdated build, but it's looking grim."
Kinda seems like the Portal video of knife vs defib is a complete load of hand fed bullshit
Killing someone with this defib would impossible unless they are prone and scoped.  Not paying attention to a single thing.  Maybe literally sleeping.
"As I said in another thread, the bugs and glitches aren't a deal breaker for me. I'm already used to all that when it comes to BF launches, but this game is going to be a pass for me for now. As per usual since BF3, wait 6 months to a year, buy it on a discount with DLC and fixed bugs."
Exactly.
I play 3 on a regular basis...servers are still up and everything
"I still play the hell out of 3. I've had to buy another PS3 because mine died just to keep playing BF3. Me and a buddy have always said Battlefield needs to stick with what made 3 and 4 successful. For a 10 year old game it has its replay value, and that right there is what made Battlefield for us."
"Idk what it was bout 4 but it felt like the vehicles were more toy like and graphics and visuals got cartoon-ish and brighter with the colors...jus felt like they was steering away from that gritty realistic graphics of bf3...game came out in what 2011 on 360 and still feels like the graphics are better than 4,1,5 and 2042 in my opinion as an overall and that was 2 generations of consoles back"
"I wholeheartedly agree, 4 didn't have the same feel 3 did. There is a realism 3 hit on and still has on an older console from a decade ago. It kills me though, seeing only about 12 servers left running on the Playstation."
Yea there's like 4 or 5 servers at any given time on Xbox...I will play that shit till it gets shut down tho cuz they nailed it on that game in a way that they jus couldn't repeat or jus didn't even bother to
"Well there's some good news in that EA is sending out beta questionnaires that ask questions on things I think were most problematic (loadouts, classes, specialists, gameplay) so I have hope that they'll listen to that and take it to heart.

The questions themselves are telling though as they know what's wrong with the game definitely."
"Overall, I was disappointed. I did have some fun, don't get me wrong, but it did not wow me at all. The sounds were disappointing and frankly the graphics, while good, were nothing to write home about either. Those are two areas that I just expect a BF game to nail and it failed.

The new specialist system is just dumb now let's be honest here. You have no idea what anyone is carrying  and who can give you ammo or whatnot. That and everyone looks the same. It was just bland with no teamwork to be seen anywhere.

The UI is a complete mess. I never had to spend a minute in a menu before to figure whether blue or black means that a toggle is On. Why is there so much shit on screen and yet I'm somehow still missing important information like which firing mode I'm on?

Then there's all the bugs. Now I know that many of those will be fixed at release or shortly after, but the fact that this is the best they could give us a month away from release is highly concerning. The map was bland, the sounds were bland, the graphics were bland and the gameplay was bland too. It could still be fun, but it was not exciting. Even the Hardline beta had me hyped for a game that it turns out wasn't actually that good. The BF2042 beta only managed to make me not want to preorder."
"The blue / black toggle thing in the menus is hilarious. How on Earth did the UX designer not see how terrible it was?

Minor gripe but somewhat strange for a title this big."
"**DICE Producer:** *”So is it the blue or the black that means you’ve selected something?”*

**DICE UX Artist:** “Yes!”"
"As someone who liked BF5 and didn’t understand the hate it garnered (outside the crappy launch), does that game still look bad? Does this look better? I don’t think it does."
"Battlefield 5 looks fantastic now, and I say this as someone who felt it was the weakest entry in the entire series. At least it still felt like a Battlefield game."
"I didn’t know what the beta was missing so I jumped on 5 for abit and instantly could feel the difference, objective based play and classes. It just felt like battlefield, the new one feels like a failed battle royal"
"BF5 never looked bad really, it just had horrible creative decisions and marketing, and a lack of a definitive vision, so we ended up with a half-baked WW2 shooter. 

The core gameplay was always solid though, gunplay amazing, and when they added new maps, especially the Pacific, we got a glimpse of true greatness that the game could have been from the very beginning. 

I still play it regularly, in fact it's my most played BF title and I've played them all since 1942. I don't think it's the best overall game in the franchise or even close, but the core gameplay is up there."
"Can get over how trash the UI looks.. had a hard time in bf3 with the over statet blue-ish tint but bf4 fixed alot of that.. now back to this horrendous UI.. feel bad for their UX designers. I mean if I run in game and look towards the sun or anything bright I cant see shit.. and the ANNOYING ARCADE DISNEY SHOOTER colors… ffs.. 

games like squad, arma, hell even pubg, tarkov.. I thought battlefield had the balls to draw inspiration from those fps-games.. not COD for babies, arcade shooters like overwatch.. I’m just disapointed, bye battlefield"
I had a large amount of fun playing the beta but what I did not like is that slide cancel BS that COD is doing. Please BF please don’t have MFer sliding into rooms then jumping to get shots off.
"Played 2 matches and uninstalled, will not be buying until it goes on sale or on Game Pass/EA play. Barely feels like battlefield, the specialists are dumb, and overall this just feels like a GAAS platform to sell skins and other battlepass microtransaction shit. I’m just so tired of it all. Can’t be arsed to care anymore when every fucking FPS has the exact same issues."
Pro battlefield 2042 strat: Wait 1 year to buy bf 2042 when its good
basically the same as the last 4 battlefield launches lol
Battlefield 1 worked fine for me day 1.
I had a lot of fun with BF1 at launch. Not as much as BF3 but pretty close.
"Tbf tho it and premium were $60 when DLC 2 launched.  There was a loooong content drought until then.

Edit: So waiting like 9 months = 50% off effectively."
My disappointment is immeasurable and my year is ruined.
"Here's the stand out points for me, I'll leave out bugs since this is a ""beta"":

Pros:

- Graphics and sound are great, as always with BF
- Gunplay feels a little better than previous Battlefield ""betas"" so that's promising
- The new attachment system is pretty neat

Cons:

- Movement feels stiff
- Quick chat is gone (request ammo, health, repairs, etc)... why get ride of this?
- Bullets drop like rocks at range and the sniper scope has no notches, why???
- All the specialists look the same between teams, so I guess hardcore mode will have red dots above enemies heads or...?
- And the elephant in the room: the class system is gone (again... why???).  With everyone being able to carry any weapon and gadget combo they want, teamwork is all but gone unless you're playing with friends.  Battlefield's class system prevented the ""meta"" of everyone using the same gun that other shooters get trapped in since you required different classes for different jobs but I fear that this new system will no longer prevent that."
My understanding was quick chat is just disabled for the beta which is..a weird choice.
This game needs a massive delay or else it will only be played for 4 months tops.
I am canceling pre-order and likely will not buy it. I was disappointed and immediately turned off by the main menu press A issue.
It's kind of sad watching new players enjoy things that aren't supposed to be in a Battlefield franchise.
[刪除]
"> This game needs like another 6-12 months of development

My feeling too. It's so bland as well. Map choice for a beta definitely didn't help either, as well as no auto aim for console players."
"100% this. Even if it was a ""months old build,"" which it isnt, there is no way they can fix all the bugs *and* redesign the completely moronic design decisions before launch. They couldn't even do only one of the two before launch.
I've never seen a game this rough be fixed in a month and neither has anyone else cuz its never happened."
"Everyone complained about the over the top BS from the Battlefield V trailer and customization, but this time they actually included over the top shit. Glaringly, way too much is going on, over the top garbage.

It decimated map flow, and it decimated team play.

Hard pass on this. It’s painfully mediocre."
"I have played all BF since 1942. 
2142 was the best imo.
This is far the worst. Doesn't even feel like battlefield. All My friends felt the same. None of us will buy this. Bf is no longer bf.

Some other dev needs to remake bf as it should be. This is just investor shit fest."
I was so excited for the 128 player thing... hardly felt like a living breathing battle at all.
"I feel like the big push in their marketing of ""OnlyInBattlefield"" or ""BattlefieldMoments"" is because they want to remind us this is a Battlefield game and not the COD mutant that it more closely resembles. Pre-Order Cancelled."
"problem with bf2042 is they are trying to copy recent  successful games like cod and apex and such

(1) gun look like made of plastic not metal ( bf1 had best look ,  )

(2) sound of guns are  feminine compared to bf1   ( not sure if it's right word ? ) ...its not heavy and loud ....nowhere close to bf1.. ..like a rubber shooting guns not metal or steel 

(3) graphic sucks ..even for beta , bf1 had best graphics

(4) feels like cod copy... motion feels cartoonish and jumpy and too fast ....like they are afraid to lose to cod ..you were / are already better you idiots  just make a bf4/bf1 hybrid and you win again

(5) too less clutter , doesnt feel like an battlefield arena ..kills the immersion

(6) jet spawning in air doesnt feels immersive

(7) way too big map . way too less chaotic action

(8) doesn't feel like army vs army head-on  war ...bf1 had this feel very good..felt like you were in real war  ....its more like "" i vs you ""  feel  NOT  "" we vs they feel """
"Did this man just refer to a firearm as feminine.
What"
"well the word gun in portuguese is ""arma"" which would be classified as a feminine word, as portuguese has gendered words so... well... in portuguese that would make sense haha"
Do the guns moan?
Yes
"Of disappointment.

The sniper rifles just sigh."
Yes agreed
"Very simple. I canceled pre order. Fool me once DICE.  
Read Tom Henderson’s story and wow this game is in a bad state. Beta was a disaster. 


https://gamingintel.com/battlefield-2042s-troubled-development-and-identity-crisis/"
"This isn't Battlefield. Shout out to EA for ruining a franchise and shout out to devs for doing whatever they want and not listening to players. 


I canceled my pre-order"
"Felt like a real sandbox battlefield to me, not sure what you didn’t like."
"I respect your opinion, but this isn't Battlefield."
"Gotta love when there are literally  page after page of detailed, savage criticism that explains all the ways in which this game fails, and someone goes: “Oh wow! Not sure what you didn’t like!?”"
Bingo. The flight mechanics alone are truly awful. Majority of my time in BF4 was spent in the little bird and it was great. The mechanics in 2042 cater to new players and there's no skill (or splash damage)
Honestly it comes down to their are more bad things than good things for me. Most of the bad however isn't easily fixable.
"I feel pretty good from the beta standpoint. I agree it wasn’t a traditional bf feel, personally I liked the changes.

Curious as to what parts make you not a fan?"
11 month old reddit acct. activated a few days ago to talk about how he loves battlefield LOL give me a fuckin break. This has to be a joke.
"Haha yeah I’m pretty new to Reddit, not to gaming. Politely, hop off"
"Battlefield 2042, the battlefield for COD players"
except warzone is actually good.
"Dissapointed. I was waiting for BF4 with better graphics, new maps. I got mix of Apex clan and cod. Simplified fps with dowgraded gameplay from bfV. On PS4 graphics is poor. And the HUD is at one time simplified and complicated. Scoreboard is shit. There is no spotting enemies like bf1, BF4, no commanding menu, no full map showing. Menu in which you chose Class and role is complicated and non-intuitive. Spotting enemies are hard, and allies are not recognizable easily
Maybe after release i will have fun but now its not what i was expecting"
[已移除]
Ditto. Only way I would pick up this game now is if Portal is somehow so amazing
"Yes, I’m going to cancel mine as well. Aside from the terrible map design, missing features, clunky movement compared to BFV, lack of said gameplay and reduced destruction, the gunplay just isn’t fun or satisfying to me. The game’s beyond saving as far as I’m concerned. Oh well, I’ll just have to stick with the previous titles for a few more years. Portal might be fun, but the game won’t be worth getting for that until it comes down in price."
"""Ps4 graphics poor"" this is getting annoying don't expect to play the latest games on old consoles and still have the best graphics. Upgrade"
"I am on next gen and I think this is a fair criticism

Next gen honestly does not look that good. And next gen has worse destruction and vehicle physics than the older games. 

Last gen doesn’t look any better than battlefield 5 which is extra bad when you realize that it went from a 60 fps game to 30"
Doesn’t look that great on PS5 either in all fairness.
"Looks great on my PS5, don't know what you're talking about"
"I'm playing on PC on max settings and honestly I was not blown away by the visuals either. 

It's not ""bad"" looking but it struck me as pretty uninspired and bland."
"This is precisely how I would describe it. 

Just for the hell of it, I opened up BFV to see what it looked like, wow there is a hell of a difference. I never played BFV until yesterday."
"BFV, for all its many faults, was a visually gorgeous game. Same with BF1. 2042, on the other hand, somehow manages to look worse than BF4. There's just something about the colors and textures that looks completely off, even if it is more graphically intensive than ever. And I'm using a 3080, not some XBox 360 type hardware."
"Exactly. I’m using a 3080 as well, but it feels like I’m playing something from 5 years ago."
I went back to BFV after 2042 and it made me realize how much more I disliked the beta.
"You know there's a problem with the graphics and art style when Battlefield 1, a FIVE year old game, looks way better than this current game."
"Not saying it looks bad, but it’s definitely not mind blowing. Hopefully it’s just the Beta…"
"I mean, it's a huge open map with 128 players. Games with such scale will never look better than classic FPS with levels the size of my flat. Obvious visual glitches aside It looks surprisingly great considering the scale."
Play hell let loose (supports 100 players) and tell me this game looks good
"> it's a huge open map with 128 players

A huge open empty map with 128 players. Most of it is just grass."
"I think you fail to realize how some other games are large scale and look amazing at the same time. A computer with a high end GPU is supposed to show off the the best graphics and yet the devs couldn’t pull that off. On the Xbox and ps5 they also lowered the graphics, it’s a shame."
"I've never seen a beta that blew people away with graphics...

Only people complaining about graphics in a beta"
"> I've never seen a beta that blew people away with graphics...

BF3 ***absolutely*** did.

The previous game the previous year was Bad Company 2, a decent looking game in its own right. Battlefield 3 was truly next generation and the beta looked like the final product. Thus, the beta was truly impressive."
"I know it’s easy to shit on bf2042 right now, but I would definitely say that this beta left a bad taste for me anyways. 

I would say that even the bfv beta looked better than this. The main issue with the bfv beta was just all the animation glitches and it had optimization problems but it looked really good from a visual standpoint. The destruction was all there, and the snow actually had to get nerfed because it was too strong. So the final version had “worse” visuals depending on if you liked how much of a snowstorm there was in the game."
"Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 5 look better on a PlayStation 4 Pro than Battlefield 2042 on the PlayStation 5. It's not subjective, it's objective. Game literally runs at low resolution on PlayStation 5 too."
looks great on my PC too
"Amen. 

Janky as fuck on Series X as well. 

I watched some clips of V last night and just thought it looked so much better."
Never tried it on the ps5 only on pc.
Looks incredible on PS5
Yeah just pay $800-$1000 for a scalped ps5
Devs have nothing to do with that though
That's the price of a ps5 not scalped here think yourself lucky then
"Accurate, but even cranked to the max on PC, the game looks very bland and is a visual downgrade compared to BFV and BF1."
I have a 3080 on PC and graphics are poor
"> ps4 graphics are poor

Flashbacks to the start of the ps4 era when people were complaining about AW/ghosts/watchdogs/bf4 looking like garbage/being stripped on ps3.

Thought we’d all learn that if there’s a prev gen version it’s likely just a cash grab."
It's not just a cash grab though. The ps4/x1 will be the platforms with the highest player counts until the shortages end. If prev gen isn't any good? This game fails.
Let’s not forget Bf4 released during the ps4’s release shortage as well.
Dude I was able to get a ps4 at launch no problem
"
We’re comparing BF4 launching after the PS4’s successful launch of 5 million units sold [followed by supply shortages](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.gamespot.com/amp-articles/sony-ps4-will-be-supply-challenged-for-rest-of-2013/1100-6416820/)

To BF5s to be launch with the [PS5 which has sold 10 million units as of Janaury](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales)"
"I mean the PS4 graphics are poor is just kind of a given. It’s a last gen console at this point, and in my opinion not a valid complaint against Dice"
Video games change as the market evolves. I for one wouldn’t want Battlefield to just be recycled/remastered every year.
"True it's necessary they try new things, but that doesn't mean that every change is for the better and I think that developers just sometimes go overboard with trying to evolve the simple things, like for example the UI.

How they changed the scoreboard to something way less clear is something nobody really asked for. What was wrong with it simply showing role, k/d and score? Now it's just a cluttered mess without any indication of how well you're doing compared to the server."
">I was waiting for BF4 with better graphics, new maps.

Thankfully DICE didn't listen to you. Why would you want outdated gunplay?"
"The gunplay in this is horrible though. They all play like bb guns. Slow bullet speed, massive drop, no damage at range. The RPG rounds are a physical anomaly. They all are the least dangerous guns in any game I’ve ever played and feel unsatisfying af."
"The drop issue is really serious. I tried playing sniper and there's huge drop off after comically short distances. 

Even more so then the DMR and some other guns which makes no sense. 

But generally yeah I agree the gunplay is bad. There's no weight to it at all."
"The snipers have to drop since the maps are so massive with almost no cover, it's the only thing preventing them from completely dominating everyone."
"Yeah I get that concept but that's really not the issue though. Drop off in general is fine. 

The problem specifically in BF2042 is that the drop off occurs at insanely short distance and snipers are worse affected by it than some of the other, non-sniper weapons."
What are you talking about? The bullet speed is like double the speed from bf1 and bfv
"Some of us have played other shooters while dice shat the bed.

^^^BF1 ^^^was ^^^good ^^^though."
">Why would you want outdated gunplay? 

Care to share examples of outdated gun play in bf4? I find bf1/v to be annoyingly unbalanced in favor of assault. Bf4 at least had options with all kit weapons."
">Dissapointed. I was waiting for BF4 with better graphics, new maps

Thank fucking god you're disappointed then. We don't need another BF4."
"Pretty close to how I felt about the beta. It’s just not ready. 

I play on PC with a 3080 and I think the graphics are a step down from previous titles."
"If you wanted BF4, go play BF4. They were never making a “new BF4”."
complaining about the game on a ps4...
"The game is being sold for the PS4 also, it's not immune to criticism."
Yeah sorry should have said complaining about graphics. Gameplay can be criticized but I don't think the hardware of the PS4 allows the Devs much room to improve graphics
lol ps4.
BF1 and BF5 were quite far removed from BF4 remakes so what made you think this would be a remake? Think you had too high of expectations.
It will suck for the first year.
The beta was bad but it wasn't as bad as bf4's beta which did suck for roughly the first year. So I give it 6 months.
"BF4 sucked for longer than that, but I still loved it. I have been hard-core on every BF game since BF3, and got 1500 hours on BF5 alone. This is the best Beta I have played on a BF game. I am super excited, but I expect problems at roll out."
"Finally. Someone with a similar opinion. I’ve played Bf since 1942, and this Beta ran way better than entire game launches for 12–16 months. The rose tinted glasses towards BF4 is STRONG. That game was absolute shit for the longest time and imo was a big step backwards from BF3 even after the fixes."
Op Metro’s battlefield 3 beta begs to differ 😂 jk it’s subjective but I’m sad I didn’t enjoy this beta
"That was fucking brilliant carnage that I wish I could relive again, what great times."
It was a letdown
"The gunplay for me just felt off. I was getting lit up by the M5 from hundreds of meters away while my sniper rounds could easily be avoided by bunny hopping and sliding around. The bullet velocities, damage/ttk, no spread or too much spread on some weapons, etc just made it horrible IMO. I was expecting a more BF3/bc2 mix for gunplay. The other things that bugged me is why the hell does the sniper not get a more long range scope with mil dots for some sliver of range acquisition. I mean mil dots have been on scopes since the late 60s. Why did it go back to the bf1/bf5/ww2 era scope? Lastly the flight physics felt very much like warzone especially for the little bird and the UI was trash in general. Sliding and the enhanced sprint was also cod like which I just don’t prefer in general. In general there are some cool features they added, but the core features and specialist system just had too many issues to overlook… 

(also I’ve been playing the series since 2002 so I’m sad to see how their games in general are being released in the last several years. It should not be the norm to release a shit product to a customer and then fix it after release with various updates, but that is what we are gonna keep getting if ppl continue to accept every dumb thing dice/ea does without any questioning/pushback in relation to
It.  When I mean pushback, it’s gotta be most of the community, but sadly for a lot of the younger gamers, this is the norm and they most likely won’t question anything or even know how different this game seems from older titles. Lot of ppl seem to just accept things and shit on anyone with a differing opinion and  many BF fans from the beginning can easily see the issues with the franchise over the last 8 years. The developers from previous titles have mostly left so I’m worried the next BF installment will just get worst by trying to pull aspects of every popular AAA FPS title out there and create a game with little to none of that battlefield essence we got from BF3/BC2/BF4/BF1/1942 and some of the other titles)"
"I think the Tactic Sprint which is clearly copied from CoD is not bad at all, but should be temporary. Maybe a 5 to 10 sek. Tacticsprint with short cooldown on the regular sprint, so i need To choose if its nessesary to use this sprint, to safe my life or outplay my enemy. But its just silly to Tacticsprint all over the complete Map."
"I generally just don’t prefer that or sliding. Yeah it could help here and there,  but I don’t really think it was necessary if they planned everything out right during the pre-development phase. Feels like they just added it in for show rather than some core functionality. Seems like a gimmick to me, but I’m sure a lot of ppl like having it."
"After Hardline and BFV failures, I thought they would go back to basic and think twice before doing any change.  
Obviously not.  
I've been an BF enthusiast since 1942 too but nowadays, I no longer preorder (not only BF, but all of them) r and sometimes skip (Hardline, BFV).

Concerning the game itself I would add the skins. PLay this game in hardcore mode, TK every seconds.

Targeting anything with tanks, planes... is merely impossible du to some lags(I guess they will fix it since it's clearly broken)"
"Yeah I haven’t preordered a game in over 10 years. Just disappointed that everything is now just about a quick way to make a buck rather than making a quality game that is both fun and robust. Besides some smaller indie companies, most of the bigger ones don’t give a crap about their fans or quality in their products anymore. Maybe the new halo is gonna go back to its roots and build upon that, but don’t see that happening for the BF franchise or CoD for that matter."
"As a LMG main, pls bring back suppression and suppression assists."
Are you me? Felt like I was shooting bbs. I love nothing more than being an annoying ass keeping enemies' heads down.
"We get all of the recoil, but none of the benefits. Using the long range scope felt useless."
"The good :  
\- The Plus System , look forward to how we can customize it. This , to me , was the best addition to this game.

  
\- TTK seems about right , might could be turned down just very slightly so maybe an extra bullet or two are needed max to take someone down but as is , is not that bad.

&#x200B;

The Bad :

\- Player movement - has taken a step backwards, thats just not a good look honestly .You should be building upon good things you create for the game not going backwards. Players move too fast, do not vault over things well, get stuck on tiny 1ft ledge/bump ups , etc. 

\- Removal of leaning ? WTH ? Just a piss poor choice honestly. We really need manual leaning to be added , again not taking away from what you had but you should be building upon it.

\- Ground vehicle physics-  are honestly some of the worst I have ever used in a game. They feel like they are floating not driving across the ground. Its literally horrible. Makes me want to take longer to get somewhere and just go on foot. 

\- USA & Russia players all looking the same? This is just flat out horrible as well. I know we can customize our players but this still needs fixing. There should be different looks of the specialists depending on which ""side"" they are fighting on . This really breaks immersion bad. Please do not leave it like this. It looks really lazy honestly.

\- All Helicopters - take way too long to bring down . They have too many smokes and can take too many rockets , this needs to be fixed. After seeing some people be able to fly them at high rates of speed and just constantly buzz objective B in ways that i highly doubt real life heli pilots could do  , something needs to be done to make them not so OP.

\- Graphically -  for a brand new made for next gen consoles ..... this is rather disappointing honestly. It looks no better than BFV on past gen consoles. Not to mention the flashing light, screen tearing , etc that took place along with lag and rubber banding. This needs serious improvements because it does not feel like a game made for next gen consoles .

\- Destruction - Look i get it , you all are really proud of the tornado , thats cool. Its a cool addition . However it really appears as if destruction in the rest of the world was tuned town in order for the game to be able to handle the tornado. This is not a very good move . 1 - massive destruction has always been a thing BF is known for. 2- the tornado does not come thru every match, thus toning down destruction for the chance a tornado comes thru is not a good trade off imo. This is very disappointing and makes me kinda hate the tornado now.

\- 3rd person only melee kills . I seriously hate this . At least give us an option. Half the time the game bugged out when it tried to quickly zoom out to show the animation and you miss what is even happening. Just give us the option , among the tons of other options you give us , to choose 3rd person or 1st person melees. This is a horrible change and likely for thinking it will somehow add revenue in people buying more skins to see it here. Its a poor idea , wont result in more sales , and makes the game worse not better because you give us no option."
"EA exists to make money for it's shareholders. They don't care about us nor do they have any gripes about releasing battlefield 2042 being the absolute mess it is if this means Christmas sales. Everyone here has clearly laid out all the issues with the beta and the developers know the game won't be finished by release. The baffling thing about EA is that their share price would sky-rocket if they just changed their behaviour and business philosophy. Even I would buy stock if they were a great company and not a greedy morally bankrupt one. EA's stock has been crab walking for 12 months now and it's performance is sad really, they should have at least benefited from the pandemic. I would never buy EA shares because I like seeing a growth in the share price and only invest in goodness because it the only way to identify a trend. It's a bad investment lacking goodness and all of EA's shareholders should be feeling pretty nervous right now with the constant scandles, regulations, bad PR and especially the current state of Battlefield 2042. So don't feel too bad gamers, EA is shafting their shareholders too."
"Things I don't like (console player):

1. The specialist stuff. This is a big one. Hopefully we can use the old classes in portal because this shit is sadly staying.

2. Holding the button to perform a take down, which is tied to just pressing to... punch? Why are we punching people to death in a battlefield game. This is so stupid imo.

3. Sliding needs a longer cooldown. This ain't Destiny. 

4. There are too much stuff mapped to the square button: reloading, picking weapons, reviving, map interactions.

5. Reviving is awful. And now everybody can revive? Which means all those revive icons are polluting the map.

6. The cross swapping thingy needs some sort of reload animation for the magazine swapping.

7. The UI is a mess."
[刪除]
Best thing I ever did was quit PC. I now play complete games worth the money and don’t have to deal with the trash community full of children that’s taken it over
Don't forget obsessing over FPS and optimization. Killed so much of the fun for me.
"I'm sorry that you didn't like this stuff mate but I honestly disagree with damn near everything you just said.

1. the specialist system isn't the best thing for the franchise but it's not the worst either. and it would be unrealistic for DICE to change that at this stage. 
2. The punching you would not believe how real this is in a real combat scenario, and the separation of the function is a necessary and beneficial feature.
3. Sliding is fine IMHO. Destiny has pretty realistic movement aside from the jump abilities, believe it or not.
4. I agree
5. The only ones that ""plagued"" my screen were my squadmates on the other side of the map. But it doesn't feel as clustered as Metro or anything like that. I don't feel inhibited by it whatsoever.
6. Some sort of application on reload would be beneficial, even if it was for all attachments.
7. Yes, yes, yes."
Canceled my pre-order due to the beta
"Me too, and now I’m sad."
"Come play the older titles, BF4/BF1 on PC has a long list of active servers ranging across almost all modes."
come play bf1
Honesty I don’t like it it doesn’t play like BF3/BF4 the mechanics of the game definitely inspired by COD
Yea the main EA people wanted dice to add an operator system like mw2019
I get this odd feeling that a bunch of the people defending this game won't be found playing this game a month after launch. The clearly haven't played a Battlefield game in years if they can't see the basic devolution in this beta. The absences of squad mechanics alone (something that took decades to polish to encourage team play) should be an obvious red flag to anyone who dedicated any serious time to the franchise in the past year.
It was the dozens of bugs for me. So fucking many oh my actual God.
"You know that even BF veterans (like myself) can have fun with that game? 

Is it a perfect game? Nope! Does it need more work? Yes! But was is that bad as half of reddit makes it? IMO not.

I dont know, is it really that bad when a Franchise wants to do stuff different from its previous games? Maybe it works or maybe it doesnt. 

See when Assassin's Creed stopped beeing Assassin's Creed for me, I just stopped buying it and moved on. Maybe people that didnt liked the Beta just shouldnt buy it and move on?"
"We don’t want to move on though. We love Battlefield. In our hearts every game should be as good as Battlefield 3 was and it’s genuinely sad to see the franchise lose its soul. 

In all likelihood, I’m switching to Hell Let Loose. Battlefield has lost me after giving me hundreds if not thousands of hours of enjoyment in games the devs actually put heart into in past years, of which this is not one. I may get the game on sale eventually just for Portal, but not until there’s more content there. Sorry DICE, it was fun."
[刪除]
There's nothing wrong with enjoying the game but there IS something wrong with people like you who act like others cannot criticize the game because you had fun.
[刪除]
lol butthurt because the game is shit
Its more like cod with bigger maps and vehicles. The core gameplay of battlefield is gone (teamplay )
"This game desperately needs to be delayed At least another 6 months.

There are core gameplay mechanics that need to be overhauled. I know my opinion doesn’t matter much but here’s what i gathered.


• Bring classes back, specialists are cool and all but the fact that anyone can can run anything takes the charm out of the team coordinating that battlefield is known for.

• Why….why are specialists not locked behind factions? Like whose idea was it to allow everyone to run the same specialists no matter what side you are on???

• The sounds throughout the map are muted and it doesn’t actually feel like a battlefield. We need more weight/impact to the audio systems.

• Medics are useless now lol, with the system that everyone can run anything and the fact that the medic syringe gun sucks… also reviving is clunky asf and needs to be more streamlined.

• Last but not least, where the hell are the squad leaders? Giving orders to your squad was awesome and honestly getting the air support and whatnot from BFV was an awesome addition. Another thing DICE could have done was allow communication between squad leaders."
"its tragic. I was dicking around seeing what other details are missing. Half of the vehicles dont even have bullet holes when you shoot them. I sat shooting at the etruck and nothing happens, no damage.
Same thing with trees and the ground. Shooting leaves no marks. Shits sad."
OOF
Squad Leaders do exist but the objective marking was completely jacked by the elimination of the Comm Rose from the Beta along with the addition of the new all-ping.
"Why is the beta over? It's still the weekend!!! I just cracked open a cold beer and sat down for an afternoon of Sunday gaming and the servers are down. What am I going to play now, then? DICE really wants people to play other games that are not Battlefield."
Go back and play (any of) BFV/BF1/BF4 with BF2042 fresh in your mind.
"Same here, I thought it was still the weekend overseas, in New Zealand, sunday is just winding down, I thought I had till mid day tomorrow or something to play.  Downloading Battlefield 4 now though"
My guess is they want to have the Sunday off. I imagine lots of people have to work whenever the beta is live.
"Probably true that many need to work while the beta is live but not having the beta up over the whole weekend (and a holiday weekend for many in the US) seems like a terrible decision. I only had a couple hours to play yesterday and have almost all of today, but guess Ill play more BF4 instead."
"That or the beta was doing a lot of PR damage so they ditched the planned extra day that they love doing when everyone is having loads of fun...

Iv not see a beta be this decisive for a long time. I can 100% say EA won't exactly be happy spending a ton on marketing only to have the only discourse been their own community saying delay the game"
"Multimillion dollar game studio can't pay 30 devs and 2 sysadmins doubletime for a beta launch, yea ok"
Maybe they want everyone to not play the new battlefield but rather batttlefield mobile in the future. Mobile games tend to make much more money for almost no development cost.
"You could play BF 4, 1, or V, all of which are still active"
You should check out Insurgency.
"1.  Specialist system instead of classes kills teamplay. Everyone is traversing the map as a ""one man army"". Even if you tried teamplaying, you would have no idea wether your teammates use one specific gadget or another.

2. Sense of scale is completely off. Fighting enemies at 100m feels more like combat at 500m. 

3. The HUD is cluttered with too much information in the wrong spots.

4. No ability to request ammo/healing etc.

5. Destruction is pretty underwhelming

6. Balancing issues (likely to be fixed)
such as air vs. infantry being absolutely underpowered. You deal pretty much no damage to ground troops.

7. Sound design is off, it's hard to hear footsteps and judge what's going on. 

8. Player movement is really fast-paced for a Battlefield game due to the addition of tactical sprint as well as sliding. Not directly a flaw but many players including find that irritating."
"Very disappointed from the Beta.

The gunplay felt ok'ish. The AI models looked great. The tornado was fun and I enjoyed the overall soundsystem.

Apart from that there was really nothing great to see.

 The game felt more like COD's ground war mode than a real Battlefield.

The vehicle controls are a disaster (especially the helicopters).

Specialists have proven to be the worst change they could probably implement. All the soldiers are fighting clones of eachother. Teamplay got eradicated.

The Plus-System is absolute shit. Their implementation of ammo types couldn't have been worse.

The UI is the worst I have ever seen in my life.

The maps are too big (even for 128 players).

Tons of bugs and glitches (I forgive them this one since it was only a ""Beta"").


I have completely lost all the Hype I had for the game. This will be the first Battlefield (apart from BF Heroes) that I am willing to skip. If they somehow are able to turn this game around in 1-2 years then I'll probably get it at a discount. But no way I'll pay full price for that."
This game is going to flop so hard. Easily the worst beta I've ever been a part of.
Playing the beta really makes me appreciate bf1 and bf4 a ton more
"Does this game feel like next gen to anyone? Other than maybe the player count, it's same old."
"Not at all, looks like a mobile game"
"Too many problems to name, not just bugs but with the core gameplay. Refunded"
"Refunded my PS5 copy. I haven't played a BF game since... 3. It was a fun game but I want to see what they have since put in from this ""3 month old"" build."
"Dude, get yourself BF4 my man. Still awesome to this day."
"Just got 1, 4, and 5 bundle for $11 on Steam lol."
Niiiice
"On last gen, gunfights felt very clunky. I don't know what it was but something felt very off. It felt like a choppier BC2 to me."
"Same here, it felt like BC2 to me for some of the movement."
"Most feedback I've seen no mention of the fact that downed enemies moving is very distracting for player visibility. Which is strange, since we already went over this in bfv and dice fixed it before. Only to bring it back once again?
That and medics revive at the same speed as normal soldiers, which coupled with anyone being able to bring med boxes/revive negates the need for a dedicated medic. 
Just strange choices by dice overall is my impressions of the beta."
"One change I do like is the transport chopper becoming a force to be reckoned with.

Incredibly specific issues I have with the beta:

Vehicle gun sights have unnecessary UI elements that make using them difficult.

The specialists items are too specific to be useful often.

To run an engineer crew is now 3, rather than 2, people. One for Missile, repair tool, & ammo box

The revive system is whack. I'd love to have a current slow squad revive, but the instant revs being able to be charged is more useful for fast combat.

What happened to the levelution? It doesn't feel as complete.

The prox grenades make camping less effective by way too much.

Biggest one is definitely the relevancy of the gadgets. Drone & turret didn't gel with the fast paced gameplay, while I ended up mainly using the heal gun on myself.

Ultimately, it's an alright experience. It definitely struggles in quite a few aspects though, and I'm concerned how long it will survive for because players might just end up going back to the games who's style it's emulating"
"prox grenate spotting has been like that since battlefield 4. 1 had the flares idk about 5 since i didn't play. 

I agree that the drone was useless. Back in 4 it was a legit gadget people used to destroy things that were annoying like spawn beacons etc and it is supposed to have the same effect here since you could ""fire"" with it BUT the only thing that was destroyable would be the OP turret. 

The god damn thing gave you esp while firing at enemies on its own. Idk why i have seen around 0 people complained about it but damn, it legit shows you the enemy through walls. I did not for the life of me understand why so little people ran it. It didn't even need to be resupplied to you because it had a cooldown of 10 seconds after being destroyed while the healing pistol had like 18 shots and thats it."
\+10% on all points earned when you're within 50' of a squadmate.
"Played bad company 2, bf3, 4, 1 & V. I enjoyed each but gravitated towards 3 and 4 mostly with their modern setting. Overall I really enjoyed my time with the Beta on Series X. The map size grew on me, vehicles became a bit easier to control with experience, and I really had a great time playing around with different specialists and funneling them into the classic support, medic or engineer roles (I'm a terrible sniper). Here is my feedback: 

* **Specialists**\- they need to have something above their heads on the field so you know who can heal and who can provide ammo. I'd also like to see them push players more towards playing those types of roles but its early and perhaps too early to tell with the other specialists how things will play out. I'm content waiting to see how it plays out at launch but some in the community have come up with some pretty great compromises between old roles and new specialists. 
* **Sound Design**\- This is my biggest gripe aside from technical issues. This needs to be looked at. I feel like over time the sound design in battlefield has gotten slowly worse. I still remember playing on my buddies surround sound system during the BF3 beta and hearing the rocket zoom past our heads. The sounds were there in this beta, they all just sounded flat, like they lacked the positional depth to really place where they were coming from.
* **UI/Menus**\- Terrible. Every battlefield that comes out seems to have the most cumbersome UI to deal with. This is even more worsened by the lack of comma rose (in for release) and the inability to pull up a scoreboard, larger map, or to set where your squad is going. Is there even a system in place to incentive squad play like in BF4, 1 & V? And the menus for the soldier selection and loadout were real confusing to navigate. Like patting your head and rubbing your tummy at the same time. Its going to be very difficult to explain to my father, who is coming from call of duty, how to set up his loadouts. Hopefully we see some improvement here. 
* **Technical issues**\- I had terrible issues on series X. Can't tell if it got worse as the beta went on or not (that would make sense). Rubber banding of vehicles was pretty bad but the visual glitches that would flip shadows when aiming down sights was really hard to overcome. 

Other than that there are some gameplay design decisions that I'd like to see fixed over time. Controlling secondary guns in vehicles for instance is a nightmare of bouncing around the screen. Aerial vehicle control also seems just a little off as does land based trucks that feel a bit floaty). 

All in all though I had a blast and can't wait to explore the other maps coming out."
For me Battlefield has always been about pacing with large map design and good gun combat. Orbital to me was an instant classic and most of the guns I played in the demo felt fun to shoot. So I enjoyed my time with the demo but I do think there's are many things that were in past games that don't exist here which is a weird step back. Bugs/rethinking class and specialist/resupply crates/making anti air a bit better to deal with helicopter dominance are stuff I'd focus on changing before shipping.
"Cons: 
I think they should go back to the BF4 weapon customization, and vehicle customization. Same with the different classes.
Implement BFV vehicle spawning where you can spawn in a different type of vehicle, but in the same group. 

I wasn't a fan of the ""on the fly"" weapon change, they also don't include many attachments like in the past, and they don't let you put on different optics for each gun, each gun has specific optics set for that gun which is a no go for me. 

I couldn't seem to figure out how to customize the vehicles, and the whole class customization thing was the most confusing thing I ever saw. I had no clue what button to press and what I was selecting.
No rewards for attachments for the weapons.

Not a fan of the reviving thing as well.

Pros:
Gameplay and shooting seemed pretty smooth once I got the right attachments I needed.

After playing for a while I got used to the helicopter controls and how they work, and was actually better than BF4.

Overall might skip this one at the start, hopefully with updates they add a bunch of stuff and change things."
"Any new feature they remove to make the game more like BF4 would be an improvement. As it stands i was pretty disappointed by the beta. I was never pre-ordered, but i am now out of the early purchase camp."
I actually enjoy on the fly weapon a lot
"I was mixed about it, because it kinda takes away from the strategy a bit, and like I said there's less attachments. Like imagine if it had all of BF4s attachments in that menu? 

Maybe keep it, but have just a ""quick select"" of your favorite attachments for the gun."
"Is there a better way to cancel PS4 pre-order than going through support chat? Long wait time today, obviously."
I don't know of any other way. I also had to wait through the support chat to cancel pre order as well. Sorry I don't have better news
"Thanks for your reply, tho!"
"I didn't play it, but I have a question for anyone who did:

Do people on your friends list show up in-game in a different colour like they did in BF4?

I ask because I play BF with a group of 5+ friends, but with four man squads, sometimes someone gets left out and you can't keep track of them in the battle. In BF4 this wasn't as much of an issue because friends had a different colour name tag, and if you were the odd one out you could still tag along with your friends just by following their names (and also BF4 had 5man squads)."
"Yes, your friend will show up in a different colour. I believe it was pale blue instead of regular green for squadmates. However there was no big map screen on the beta so sometimes it was a little tricky to find your teammate if you got separated."
"IMO all the idea about Classes Vs Specialists, I would love a mix between them.

For example the healing lady being a medic class and for her unique trait have the healing gun, another one have a healing field, healing drone, etc. 

That would make specialists a nice “addition” to the classes and more options to play."
This is at least better than what they are now. Everyone is everyone.
Reminds me of Black Ops 3/4
You could just have classes but let people select those as their class-specific gadget. Am I repeating what you're suggesting?
Was there there anything that showed how long a headshot was?
"Another problem I had was spotting. I know 3d spotting is controversial as hell, but overall I still think it has it's place. I think you can tweak in such ways that it's still useful but not obnoxious or a crutch like in bf3/4/1. 

If you limit spotting range and visibility to close by players only (30m-50m?), you've already fixed most of the issues with spotting. Maybe also make it like in bf5 that you have an indicator that tells you that you're spotted.

That and make 3D spotting unavailable to vehicles, only make it visible to those on the minimap. 

Not that I think any of this is going to happen, but just my input."
"Usually a group of 6 of us that play it, this is the first time (par Hardline) where we won't be picking it up.

We've all played together since 1942 on the PC, and most of us feel that it's gone too far in the direction of COD.

My list of gripes is exhausting, and I'm normally very positive about most games, though my biggest issue is the pacing.

If you slapped another title on it, then fine. But to me it feels like a cheap knock off of Battlefield.

They didn't need to re-invent the wheel just to try and cash grab from APEX/Cod players.

They need to get rid of that Drunkzee or whatever he's called, they shouldn't have given an ex pro COD player a job as a gameplay designer."
Okay see ya
"You sir, have earned the downvote."
Downvote me more
"Left me super disappointed honestly. Loved bf5 and bf1 but this beta seems to show a huge regression in so many ways. Cancelled the pre order, gonna wait to see how if anything changes in release."
what the fuck? they ended it before the weekend is over? garbage
Makes no sense. Most people's play time is on the weekend anyways. Sure Friday Night and Saturday but why not more on Sunday?
EA thinks gamers don't play games on Sunday
Real gamers go to church
Church is 1 hour
Lol
Sad these young kids will never know what a true battlefield game is. All they've had experience with is BFV and this beta. Just wish they could go back in time and play Bad Company 2 and come back and see how truly shitty this game is.
fuuuck yea +1 for bad company
"I'd give a solid mention to BF3, it's what pulled me away from COD and have never gone back"
"I one day hope for a battlefield game to be like Battlefield 2, but I doubt it'll ever happen."
"Disappointed.

Players all look the same, there is no sense of team identity.

Specialist system is probably one of the worst systems out there. 

Playing on the US or RUS team literally doesn’t matter because specialists are from any country. 

Sometimes confusing to pick up targets. How about you either 1 faction lock specialists, or 2 can the entire idea of specialists and go back to standard soldiers. 

Guns sounds weak and not punchy. It’s like paper. Theres no oomf, no true sound of the gun cycling, firing, slamming the bolt. 

Vehicles are extremly squirrelly even though they said they improved vehicle driving. Helicopters are the same way. 
 
Movement is too fast. Sliding too fast and far, just get rid of it. If you drop these gimmicky movements like sliding or jumping and bunny hoping you force players to think about engagements and moving to cover.

Minimal destruction for a game that touts destruction. Breaking fences is nothing special anymore if it ever was. Buildings should be able to collapse. The tech demo they showed early on that included destruction is not reminiscent of what we have in this game. 

Lots of work to be done on this game. It feels like a purposely unfinished product with the targeted audience 12 years old."
Agree and would add that gunplay feels like crap on Xbox series x.
">Movement is too fast. Sliding too fast and far, just get rid of it. If you drop these gimmicky movements like sliding or jumping and bunny hoping you force players to think about engagements and moving to cover.

I never realized how janky the sliding and moving was until I went back and played BFV. It is so much smoother. 

&#x200B;

I love MW2019 and APEX but to see the same spastic movement (sliding and jumping)in a Battlfield game is weird AF. I did see that it is getting toned down. I say just get rid of it. 

&#x200B;

>Minimal destruction for a game that touts destruction. Breaking fences is nothing special anymore if it ever was. Buildings should be able to collapse. The tech demo they showed early on that included destruction is not reminiscent of what we have in this game.

&#x200B;

Even though there are structures that can not be destroyed there are areas that look decimated by the end of the match. Like the C flag near the tunnel from Flag D. The ground is obliterated with huge holes from explosions. All the trees are basically gone. I saw one match these 2 pilots destroyed all the trees on C flag LMAO!!  


But anyway the game has more subtle destruction. Buildings no longer come down but you can take out just about ever wall like on the buildings around D flags.   


I think from a gameplay perspective the no longer want whole 2 story buildings coming down ala Paracell Storm BF4.   


Even in BF1 iirc you could not take out any full structures. Like Sinai Desert. All the buildings stay intact. 

&#x200B;

I think damage at least full building damage was taken out after BF3 and was limited in BF4."
"Destruction came back in bf1 and yeah you could destroy the roof on many buildings. I believe its the same in bfv. Nothing collapses though in either of these games. I’m not sure why they flip flop between games like this. Bc1/2 had the best destruction, then 3 comes out and its almost non existent, bf4 comes out and has some but pushes the levelution thing which becomes repetative and boring, bf1 returns to full destruction, bfv maintains that, and now 2042 goes backwards again."
"Specialists -  Removes team identity and breaks immersion when you have multiple of the same character on screen and on different factions.  I don't mind there being more than 4 Kits if that's the direction the series wants to go...  but you know if you just take a look at a game called Bad Company 2,  that game had selectable perks as well.  Guns are no longer tied to classes as well,  and this makes the game even less team-based as now.  

Spotting - Controversially,  I like how spotting in this game works currently.  It's much more harder,  and it's easier to run away from gunfire because enemies don't have to track the little red marker above your head.  It makes tracking way harder and makes the game feel much more better for both the shooter and the victim.

Plus System (Changing attachments on-the-fly) -  This system is absolutely terrible.  Do you plan to remove weapon mastery/leveling too?  A lot of the fun that stems from Battlefield is the grind that complemented fun gameplay.  For the most part,  the gunplay feels good and is much more challenging than previous titles;  that's good.  But having a system that essentially removes even gun classes where an Assault Rifle body can easily become an SMG, an Assault Rifle,  and a DMR seems a little ridiculous and is too versatile.  Why should one gun be able to do everything?  Having this system does not complement the class system from previous games where certain classes had certain weapons.

Beta in General -  Conquest sucks.  Why are you still marketing player counts?  Does anybody still actually care?  We've long moved past the 12 player COD lobbies.  You could have at least left in Rush or Operations esque game mode like you did for the BF4 beta.  There's also way too many AI.. im sure that AI is taking more resources than actual players even.  Where is cover lean?  Where is Zeroing?  Where is DLSS?  Where is Battlefield honestly?"
"Everyone complains about the operators, they are not great, but the problem is different.

If the operators drew a specific class, everything would be cool, including the fact that you are constantly looking at your own face.

When everyone has a choice of medipack, ammo pack, or rocket launcher, it's not hard to choose. We need clearly defined tasks for meaningful team play, a scout shouldn't have a rocket launcher, neither should a medic, and an antitank doesn't need a sniper rifle or Medipack but C5. Instead, the individual gimmicks that make up each operator should be optional for each class, allowing everyone to change their playstyle a bit for each class.

Furthermore, the respawn time must be significantly adjusted. It can not be that I am rewarded with immediate respawn, if I give up directly after being knocked down, and not wait for a medic. The whole thing is reinforced by the fact that I can spawn almost immediately at each teammate. This should be limited, either spawn only at the squadleader, or after task 10 sec respawn on regular spawn points (base / flag) and 15 sec on squad spawn."
Getting rid of class specific roles has ruined battlefield imo only having certain guns/gagets with certain classes is what made battlefield battlefield you guys are just trying to turn it into something that’s not battlefield at all I had high hopes for this battlefield but looks like it’s back to BF1-BF4-BF5 for me until they sort out the mess that is battlefield 2042
"Takes way to long to kill people, especially with higher caliber rounds/weapons. Snipers and dmrs/lmgs are useless. Need to bring back suppression BADLY as well. Feels like cod. If they brought in hardcore servers/modes for all maps and modes it would rectify at least this one issue for me."
Meh.
"Probably unpopular opinion but I really liked how you could build fortifications and change the map in 5, I wish that had returned."
"Agreed. It was definitely something they sold too hard during the initial marketing which made people skeptical, but in the end it was a cool little addition."
"The Fortress game mode made excellent use of fortifications.  I think if that feature was in BF1 I would have liked the map design much better, *and* Support could have been more valuable."
The fortification system seemed like the first draft of a really good idea that could only get better. I too am disappointed by it's absence.
A whole studio is making multiplayer only and this is what they can muster ? It's sad
Not to mention they had multiple studios working on this. They post poned the new NFS game for this.
I hope to god that they didn’t think “lets have Criterion do the vehicles” or something because that could explain the massive shift in the flight and driving model.
Or maybe they did
"And only 5 maps, right? So not even really a ton of MP. I'm trying to figure out what they spent their time on, maybe the portal thing?"
"Portal is being made by a different studio, so I have no clue what they are doing. But I knew shit like this would happen, some players wanted to not ""waste"" time on a campaign to focus on mp. And now there is no campaign and shitty multiplayer"
"7 maps, plus the maps for portal."
"I refunded after playing the Beta. I don’t care if people want new things, I don’t. Going back to BF4, the last true BF."
This is the best summary.
Is this THE Robbaz? That's a name I haven't seen in a hot minute
Seeing you guys shit on this game makes me happy inside.
Did not enjoy what i played (pc). I know the build was allegedly a 3 month old build but there was a lot of things they need to fix or change. I hope they delay the game to release it polished. I better not hear no excuse about “well BF3 and BF4 were buggy at launch so deal with it”. We need to hold these companies accountable. We are forking up 60-70 bucks for a multiplayer ONLY game. It better work on release. On another note the Specialist system is ass and motivates one man army playing instead of actual squad/team play. I know they are ditching the class system because the Specialist system is more mtx friendly(sell us skins similar to Apex).
"This proves that every time they say “it is a love letter for the fans” it is just a mess that change everything and want to appeal to other customers.

IMO (you can think differently it is fine) this game was made for streamers: no class systems so they can have everything they need for a “crazy trick shot like the trailer!” (All weapons, perks, specialists, etc). 

When they revealed these changes I thought “oh they are gonna kill BF. No, let’s try it, maybe hands on the game feels good and it is really like Battlefield 4”. Sadly, I was right. DICE just saved me 60 dollars"
It reads more like a hate letter to me.
"Anyone else surprised by how primitive the grapple was? If you grappled into a vehicle it would just take you to that stationary point, even if the vehicle left. It felt like the grapple gun was completely separate from physics, which was surprising in a game like this when so many other games are doing grappling better."
Especially given the tornado physics... I figured they would've thought out grapple physics attached to a moving target.
"After horrible launch state of Battlefield 3, 4, Hardline, 1, V, Battlefront 1, 2 you would THOUGHT that both EA and Dice would learn from their past mistakes and experiences but nope - another garbage Battlefield that will be garbage for probably couple of months with rabidly dying player base and bunch of blind fanboys defending it but quitting the game after couple of hourse just in time for another new Battlefield game announcement while EA asking for more and more money on day 1 with even more expensive digital deluxe editions and more cut out content to be sold as DLCs with a sprinkle of microtransactions or battlepasses, promises of roadmaps and onther magical unicorns.

A viscous cycle of triple A games as they say.

It feels like Battlefield games over the past 10 years got more and more expensive with less and less content with more and more bugs and greedy bullshit.

OH WAIT probably because thats exactly how it is. Someday this bubble will burst for EA and the faster that will happen the better for your average consumer."
"Lol they’ll never get them right at launch.  

BF2 was unplayable for like an entire year after launch, then they launched 2142 literally the week they fixed it. BC2 was pretty bad too, VOIP didn’t work for years on PC.  

BF1 probably had the most stable launch build we’re ever gonna get."
">BF2 was unplayable for like an entire year after launch

Wow I didnt even knew that. And here I thought that at least that game got it right but nope"
so does this mean we are all going to back to BF4?
"For now that seems to be the case, can't judge too much before the official release though. Would be crazy if BF4 gets more players than BF2042 after launch"
Yep and BF1
"Nope, I am staying."
did you play the beta? if so what did you like about it that you are staying?
I did play the beta and I thought it was very fun to play because of all the bugs there were and the gunplay was fantastic compared to other games.
"Loved the beta, since it saved me from getting the game on release or anytime soon really.

•Bugs everywhere, so many bugs.

•Graphics look BAD. Like words than BF4, which is mindboggling.

•Gunplay felt meh. Entire weapon classes like DMR and Snipers are broken.

•Bad physics, bad netcode, bad hitmarkers, bad UI.

•Helicoptors flew like planes and planes flew like big, soapy trucks.

•Bad visibility and specialists meant constant confusion and friendlies shooting at friendlies.

•Specialists and no squad leaders ruin the team element. Everyone just doing their own thing, nobody is reviving or passing ammo.

•If this is their best map, they got problems! It’s big and mostly empty, fewer destructive elements than in other BF games.

•So many cool features and abilities from BFV are missing, weird movement.


The game didn’t feel like Battlefield, but like a cheap F2P knockoff of Apex mixed with CoD with a BF skin.

Yeah, when Infinally stopped playing ”Battlefield” and just started goofing around, running over people with cars and marveling at the bugs I had some fun, but before then the game felt boring and unsatisfying. 


Also: NO AIM ASSIST WITH CROSSPLAY?!? What are they thinking?

No map?!? This game feels like it was developers by people who never actually played BF."
">If this is their best map

No one said this was their best map.

>Bad physics, bad netcode, bad hitmarkers, bad UI

some vehicle physics were really weird, what was wrong with the hitmarkers? I quite liked them. The UI when playing wasn't bad. I like them too but the top bar telling we took the objective etc was down right bad. Same with the main menu. Very big and blocky.

>So many cool features and abilities from BFV are missing, weird movement

I can agree that BFV had better movement like the climbing and out of reach animations were just abandoned on the beta.

>NO AIM ASSIST WITH CROSSPLAY?!? What are they thinking?

They are thinking about equality or do you want me to slightly turn on the aimbot?

>Specialists and no squad leaders ruin the team element. Everyone just doing their own thing, nobody is reviving or passing ammo

i agree with this one. When everybody can be their own army no one will help anyone. I revived only my squadmates because why would i play the medic role when i can already heal myself with health kit that every class can now equip.

>Graphics look BAD. Like words than BF4, which is mindboggling.

I guess you aren't playing on PS5 or PC? Because the graphics are actually pretty nice.

>DMR and Snipers are broken

DMR IS BROKEN? It's underpowered. 4 shots to mid range and 5 to 8 to long. Sniper has always been 2 shots to body and 1 for head. It's annoying how some people want the sniper to be the 1 shot killer like in CoD.

I didn't see any big bugs when playing. The elevators were little buggy like the doors wouldn't stay open but you could still walk through them also the insides of elevator seemed like there wasn't any texture on them. Got the same feeling when watching some of the vehicles. They were just plain gray."
“I didn’t see any bugs while playing” - I’m directly calling you a liar. The beta was riddled with bugs of all sorts.
"""I didn't see any big bugs when playing"" is my original sentence so please don't put words in my mouth. I said BIG bugs. There were minor bugs here and there but not anything that i would call game breaking."
">They are thinking about equality or do you want me to slightly turn on the aimbot?

haha you are shit. Do you know how hard it is to aim with a controller and no aim assist? Mouse and keyboard players are already at a massive advantage, i played both on PS5 and PC and the difference was night and day. Did you?"
"Im out with this bf. For me they are approaching cod too much and miss too much of what bf always made special. If i want to have cod, i play cod not bf."
"No worries
See you in a few months when you return."
Still didn‘t purchased and I don’t plan to ;)
"I’ve really enjoyed my time playing the beta. Just some things that could get some attention:
- readability of enemy/friendly team 
- gadgets should be shuffled around a bit. Nobody feels te need to use ammo/medic crates atm. Maybe allow to swap our specialist ability for an extra gadget? 
- the UI is atrocious, I am not even talking about aesthetics but functionally. Half the time I couldn’t see what sector an objective marker was showing. 

Other than that, I’m positively surprised. The game shows a lot potential."
"The UI is a total joke. I cant even bring up the fucking map to orient myself. Why did they change up the TAB overlay? Why cant I see how other players on my team is doing, but only my squad? I dont need it to tell me my kills deaths and assists *twice*.

The UI in general also just looks cheap. The killfeed is a joke (its just text. Its not colourcoded, or bracketed or anything, to help clarity at a glance). The objective markers are super visible from long ranges (to the point where it obscures your view), but you get so lost when youre actually on the objective. The minimap doesnt tell you where the capture zone for the objective is. Ive died at least 3 times because the guy I was shooting at was obscured behind an ammo pickup icon from his teammate that I just killed.


It just feels cheap."
">  The objective markers are super visible from long ranges (to the point where it obscures your view)

The number of times I died because an enemy was either hidden by an objective marker or looked like an ally due to the blue indicator..."
I like the getting rid of the specialist ability for another gadget sort of thing. Ammo and health boxes for everyone from me lol. I hate the stupid stim gun as it’s useless for everyone else pretty much
Imo the stim gun needs a heavy auto aim. Something akin to Merci in Overwatch
I agree. Or at least make it hit scan and not have bullet drop. It’s darts are slower then my bullets so it’s hard to aim that thing
The only reason I could see ammo crates being used is if you’re sniping and miss a lot of shots like I do. I used a ton of ammo crates lmao
"With the absolute state 2042 will be in if they keep their current release schedule and the fact EAs stock has been crab walking for the last 12 months, I'm going to short EA if they don't delay the game until next year."
"No you're fucking not. Everybody knows that you don't have the fucking money to short EA nor will Robinhood let you degenerates play with house money anymore, so you're just making shit up because you discovered a minimal understanding of how the fucking stock market works in the past 10months thanks to meme stocks"
Watch me fan boi
I'll put my refund money towards it just to flex
"I refunded. Sucks, i was super excited to dive into a battlefield game as i wasnt at all interested in the last 2. The trailor was great, the hype was real, and the product was lackluster, awkward, and disappointing."
"Bring back classes and I'll consider it. Otherwise I'm good with playing BF4 until either dice pulls their head out of their ass or they put it on gamepass. I'm not paying $60 for this one. I've already been disappointed in the last two. 

I don't understand how they fucked this up so bad. They literally could have copy/pasted BF4 with some modern graphics and I would have bought it."
"Cancelled my pre order. Might get EA play pro for a month at launch, but I dunno."
Delay the game. I'll continue to play insurgency sandstorm in the mean time! It has so much more potential than 2042 imo
With this garbage battlefield it made me think how awesome it’d be to have a game that pulls the smooth gunplay and ‘classes’ with load pit point systems from sandstorm and put them in a larger arena like the battlefield series
"I will refund this...  
They've take BF 4 and removed core stuffs.  
This game is like COD with bad vehicles... meh  


We dont even have the full map, hahahahaha  
WTF are you doing DICE? A COD COPY!?  


NO THX!"
"I cancelled my pre-order.

I'm sad about it.

But this is a broken game. It feels like cod with vehicles. Core mechanics are shot to hell."
"You've summed up my thoughts succinctly.

My first impression was that I was playing g Cod rip off of Battlefield; ground war. Vehicles OP af, infantry just running around aimlessly, and ultimately objectives don't really matter. It's just a TDM fustercluck disguised as objectives.

Conquest is the weakest part of battlefield in my opinion. I was really hoping to try rush or some form of ""operations"" like the past two battlefields have presented."
"Much agreed, but for me cp was the fresh thing battlefield introduced and honed over the years. It made for at least some semblance of battlefield tactics to capture a less protected cp when all the others were focusing on the others. 

You'd actually feel ""a sense of accomplishment"" if you alone or with a squad captured a point, set up some defending measurements, c4 here, mines etc and actually held that cp a long time feeling you turned the focus or even the tide of the battlefield. People would spawn in and stuff felt like we all saw the benefit of holding this cp and draining the enemy of tickets rather than fighting the stalemate over at cp D and C. 

This beta however was just a clusterfuck."
"Was really hard to tell friendly and enemy players. Really sucked the fun and immersion out. But overall, kinda enjoyed it."
Is it really that hard to make a team A and B version of each character? This is utterly stupid at the moment
"Shooters in the late 90 early 00's got it right with a hue/color change. I'm baffled at how nobody at DICE thought of adding that for a *team shooter*. I mean Quake 3 had a ""same model"" (using Sarge for better performance on PC's of that era) option and even *that* would change the color of what the model was wearing in team-games."
"I would call it okay if they reverted to class and if there was 2 development years left. People need to understand it's not the dev time, it's the bad devs. All the good ones left."
Seriously? Is there any articles on this? Id like to read
I second this. Have an article? I had no idea that the original devs actually left (if you are correct).![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_bad_man)
You can read the company reviews and how bad practices culminated from 2017-2018.
How involved in the game development scene are you?
"Software engineer, voice actor and writer."
Nice! That's a big variety. And you do those in the context of video games?
"Yep, just did some voice acting for a game that's about to release."
"How did DICE lose all their ""good"" devs?"
"The ability for Helicopters to regenerate health and have infinite ammo is ridiculous.  
Make them need repairs and send them back to base or to a station to refuel."
"It was awful. So many systems have regressed. Planes and heli control terribly. Ui is even worse than bf v  movement and and gunplay massive steps back. Specialists arent good, classes were better. General performance with regards to hit detection and network is terrible."
"I think the problem with the game and why it might have felt boring was because of the massive map. But the main problem was it being conquest and having NO FLOW other than Zone D1&D2. Orbital is a huge map but half the time it just feels empty and with no life. 

I think conquest was a bad choice to have put on this map, maybe another Gamemode like rush or something ? The Last Gen version of the beta plays much better in my opinion."
"Done my best to keep my game design hat on.  

Open maps make older battlefield tactics of flanking and positioning much less rewarding. 
Having to dump too many resources against air vehicles is simply not fun. 
In general it feels like the only way to take objectives is to throw more bodies at objectives than the other team.

Biggest issue is that it is so hard to think tactically what to do next. The ability for anyone to respawn in a helicopters
makes battle lines non existant and makes decisions on which objectives to attack/defend non existant. Back caps should not be this common.
Also makes Dice's decision to map objectives split into two points redundant due to how chaotic battles are.

Another concern is fighting the AI opponents. that they're indistinguishable from players makes Showing and aggression 
a much tougher choice. Would much rather show against real players than bots. problem is exacerbated by open maps.

Biggest band aid i'd like in the game is to remove respawns in choppers/ limit them to only respawn if squad member is in one. Second is vehicle cooldowns and ammo resupply rates."
"I think these are good suggestions. Honestly hasn't considered how spawning on friendly helicopters impacted flow, but you're right.
Most of my flanks failed, but getting back into the battle was easy enough that it wasn't a huge letdown for me."
"Didn't play personally but have been watching streams and videos. I got that similar sense that there are no longer Battle Lines.

But then again, my favorite bf is probably BC2 where battle lines were VERY visible. Bf3 did it well too.

Wonder if it's due to map design? Not enough forced routes via environment/tough terrain? Too many control points?

Also is the AI backfilled? Or do they exist amongst the 128 players? Did anyone get a full human server??"
"The good:

- battlefield shenanigans are back
- I really like the + system it makes conquest specifically really feel good going from flag to flag, by being able to tweak the gun for engagement distances.
- map flow was pretty decent, I’m not much of a conquest player so it doesn’t feel much different than the typical match on B1,3,4,5 or BC2
- loved being able to call in vehicles and support anywhere. (When it worked)

The bad:
- specialists
- lack of cover between flags
- heli dominance
- always felt like I was getting shot in the back from out of nowhere the choppy game and lack of spacial awareness made it really disorienting
- optimization is trash getting 30fps with a lot of chugging when BF4,5,1 all run great on my rig. 
- classes don’t incentivize teamwork and it’s a big problem in conquest feeing like a lone wolf
- similar to the last one, ammo is hard to come by, make it a drop just like vehicles, can’t be spammed but gets you going in a pint h. 

The ugly
- I think the community response is overly negative, there’s a lot of shit they need to fix but this feels very much like a battlefield game 
- spawning in this game is a fucking trash fire of luck
- close quarters combat is nowhere near as enjoyable as a typical battlefield title, characters move too quick and it just feels off


Overall a lot of shit to fix DICE, but I think we’ll see it evolve into a solid title. As long as operations and rush feel good, I’ll be satisfied"
"This comment sums it up perfectly for me!

Other things I might ad:

The Bad

* Missing UI in gunner seats that shows you the position of your gun in relation to vehicle direction
* Spotter seats seem useless and are only good for transport and spawn
* Chromatic abberation is too strong in vehicles
* Missing grenade indicators
* Somehow my AA rockets never hit the targets even when they popped the flares and I kept aiming at them

The Ugly

* Melee fists are absolutely atrociuos and clunky, bring melee weapons back from BF1/BFV
* Reviving feels unsatisfying and the animation to get up is extremely long and should removed completely"
"A lot of great feedback I agree with. I haven’t seen anything regarding the lack of squad controls??

Signaling to advance, attack or defend an objective, ask for health or ammo. Where tf is that. Seems very independent for a squad based game."
"Probably left out of beta.

Since, you know, its only a hunch of people running around and not caring"
On PC if you landed the squad leader role you could actually use the spotting key to order attack and defend orders on points. But the problem was you could only do it reliably if the point symbol/icon was in you view with sky behind it. I’d you tried to do it with the icon placed in front of terrain or a building you’re would just issue a marker (it would show a yellow waypoint)
I found that sometimes the marker would be way below the place you'd placed it and you couldn't remove it
I am actually shocked DICE kept the BETA up for so long and didnt cut it sooner to prevent more pre-order cancelations.
I suspect that pre-orders were largely unaffected despite what you might think by looking at the sub reddit. The community on here is much smaller than the battlefield community at large.
"Oh it's true this is a very small subset. On an anecdotal note, me and a friend didn't preordered, and don't plan on buying the game at all after playing the BETA."
"Tbf I didn't pre order either. I only had access through game pass ultimate. With that said I felt that the beta was mostly fine. I get some of the complaints coming from here, but we'll have to see what changes come launch day. Or hopefully we get a post launch roadmap of some sort."
"It's been said many times, but I really don't care for the specialist+loadout system. It massively overcomplicates deployment and it kills squad play. Feels super wrong for a sniper to have an ammo box and a medic to have a rocket launcher. Moreover, the fact that each time I switch specialists it stays with the current loadout is annoying. The specialists basically correspond to assault/support/recon/medic anyway, so what the hell? BFV actually pretty much perfected the classes IMO by giving you clear roles. If we MUST have this specialist system, they need to at least make it faster and easier to deal with. Ultimately, I really think the game needs classes with clear roles.

On the positive side, I am really enjoying the drone. Some of the other gadgets are a touch too Fallout/Wolfenstein, but I can live with that."
"I will admit that I had fun and I played the game for maybe 12 hours over the beta period. I would estimate that my breakdown is 8 hours solo and 4 hours on Discord Audio with friends. I also spent a bit of time.. too much time.. reading what others thought.

***Summary TL,DR: The BETA was so technically broken I can not make any objective evaluation or prediction of the full release overall gameplay experience.***

Full Summary:

The hot topic over the Beta period has been the issue of lack of teamplay. I did not notice too much teamplay myself when playing solo. It could be frustrating and many people have blamed this squarely on universal kits and specialists. I disagree and feel like the lack of teamplay was due to poor decision making regarding the included Beta feature set. In fact I did see some decent teamplay at times but you had to look for it.

The beta launch did not have Squad VOIP, the Comm Rose, or even Text chat included. In addition due to the all-ping system and technical issues with audio you were not getting squad leader commands or hearing when someone dropped an ammo box or health box or calling for revive. These are all other methods of coordination beyond simply looking for visual ques. So this is where I disagree with a ton of arguments that teamplay is dead because the toolset that enables teamplay was cut down to basically playing a game muted with the text chat turned off.

When I think of past games I want to say that visual ques was my last method of coordination in public. If I need medic or ammo I'd use the comm rose to request it. I also would almost always thank people and/or respond to squad leader commands. This level of acknowledgement feeds back into encouraging team play. Consider that during the beta without chat or audio ques you could throw down an ammo box and have little idea if people found it useful or not. On top of that you were reliant on your squaddies or team visually seeing that you even did it because there was no audio callout on their end to inform them it was done.

The time that I ran with 3 of us on Discord Audio the game was completely different. We could talk, we could coordinate kits, we could call revive, we could do almost everything we used to do because we could communicate."
"They gotta delay this, it’s a shit heap"
"Canceled my pre order after beta this isn’t battlefield at all like it’s sad how far DICE has strayed from there roots that made battlefield battlefield and being so epic a game and so distinct it’s very sad times I just hope they listen to fan feedback and just give us back to basics battlefield like BF3-BF4 style gameplay for 2042 ,skins are fine but leave them as optional things to equip or purchase or get through battle passes the named specialists system has to go."
"I thought the gameplay was okay apart from the bugs (especially the parachute one) but don’t like the operator system at all. It makes it so much harder to see the enemy team, even when they do have a red marker. Just make the uniforms on each team a different colour or something"
I'm sad and disappointed.  It's so many things that are missing or changed to enumerate.
"I have the perfect image to sum up my experience. 👍 😃

https://i.imgur.com/3YicdNd.png

Betas are great to get a feel for the game, like a demo."
"Robbaz! Been a long time fan of your videos, glad to see we got the same conclusion from the beta lol."
"Yup, that’s really what they are these days. Free demo/previews.

The real betas are the ones the poor playtesters has to deal with 6 months ago. (Poor dudes!)"
😂🤣😂
"Dice been at it for nearly 2 decades now, and still haven't figured out how to balance homing missiles. [It's so fucking easy to do](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/q4qlku/dice_please_improve_2042s_air_combat/), but they just refuse to improve it.

Not to mention that vehicles in general still feel paper-thin."
"Had a ton of fun, but many things need to change.

God awful UI, for some reason it felt great in the trailer but in game it's just way too big.The thick top line when objectives are captured takes too much space for no reason, it feels like my whole screen if moving down.

Revives are unlimited, not good at all ! It was perfect before, just 1 revive and then instant death. I don't understand why it's ""hold E to revive"" while in the trailer we saw defibrillators ?

Animations feel worse than previous games, knife killls aren't looking great.

Had quite a few desync and got killed after I went in cover.

Sniper headshots sometimes do not kill instantly, but sometimes they do ? Weird.

I thought we were going to have more advanced destruction given the new Frostbite videos.

I never felt like there was 128 soldiers on the field ? Might be related to the size of that map.

The game needs to remember what class I picked previously and what attachements ! Many times I thought I was about to place a turret while the game changed my class and got killed opening my drone suitcase. I don't also want to select my attachements at every start of a match.

I never know when I can airdrop something with B. The game needs to tell me visually what is unlocked. Also, sometimes it never spawned what I asked but I guess it's a bug, I thought I didn't have enough ressources of some sort.

Sound design didn't feel as good as previous BF like 3 or 4 ? Gunshots in tight corridors sound weak and there's no echo.

Sometimes ennemies had a big red outline and I have no idea why ? That's a bit too casual.

On the graphics side, day time doesn't look great on this map. Not sure how to explain :/ Looks flat, no shadows, like it's 12:00. When the weather got cloudy and rainy, it looked absolutely amazing tho.

&#x200B;

Other than that I had a ton of fun honestly ! I didn't mind the specialists and never had a case where I shot a friendly, but in Hardcore mode it's going to be a big problem, teams need to be more visually different."
"Pros:
Graphics

Controls

Guns felt nice to shoot

Weather system was nice

Radio added interesting info

Cons:
Bullets damage for dmr and snipers needs buff

Recoil felt too CoD-like

Map was way too big

Specialist system didnt really change the game all that much

Barely anyone realised that any Spec can rez

Health reg felt too rapid for soldiers and vehicles

Helicopters could evade AA ridiculously easily

Couldnt tell who was on the other team half the time"
"The tornado and rocket are fucking useless. You should be able to sabotage the rocket so it veers off course and crashes down on the B flag building changing the flow of the map significantly. Could even collapse the tunnel or something. The tornado is a joke, it barely does any damage, you have to want to die to get killed by it, it's completely non threatening. People also stop playing the objective to drive trucks into it which while funny messes with the flow of the match.

Battlefield 4 levolution and map destruction were infinitely better, this just reeks of wasted potential."
"I got to rank 20? 21? So played a fair bit of it.

It just felt incredibly unfinished (yes, I know, it's an old build*) and I think the terrible server performance just exacerbated the problems that the game has. After like 5-10 minutes into the match everything would just get jankier and jankier as the server seemed to struggle more and more. A lot of the jank reminded me of server stresstests back from the old BF4 CTE days. The server and client just seemed in constant disagreement over what is actually happening and presenting you with a sort of interpolated mess.

This is on top of all the things that have been mentioned numerous times by now, but to name a few:

* Squads seem meaningless apart from reviving and spawning 
* Squad leader position is equally meaningless. Can't even tell if an objective is marked to attack/defend (nor get any points for doing so?)
* no comm-rose 
* pinging seems completely pointless 
* no full map 
* one gun just straight up not saving the config
* game randomized the specialist every round for some reason which was made worse by the fact that sometimes on first load you weren't able to change anything and could only deploy with a random specialist and whatever your last loadout was
* specialists kind of hurting team composition (I think I've seen people drop an ammo box twice)
* screen seems completely cluttered with info and at the same time almost none of it being useful
* in general the feedback to the player seems lacking
* hiding the (useless) ""score""board behind hitting Esc then clicking Squads & Players is such a strange choice and no visual distinction who is in your squad if you want to switch squads or forfeit the (useless) sqaud leader position to someone else on there.
* Reviving being the same button as picking up someone's kit lead to a lot of frustration and deaths

It's hard to judge the game's gunplay, movement and feel due to the aformentioned server performance issues, but I'd say it was too close to ""Warzone, but worse"".

I was a big fan of BF3, BF4 and BF1, but skipped BFV because the beta back then didn't convince me and I was kinda done with WW2 shooters. The 2042 announcement and trailer and gameplay had me excited for a new battlefield, but this beta has turned me off.  

\* This beta is/was an advertisement, it's the first (and for some: only) time people will get to test the game before having to fork over full price for it. A bunch of people will base their purchase decision and opinion of the game in no minor part on this. So why put out such a busted version? ""A lot of the stuff is already fixed"" does nothing for how janky and unpolished and unfinished pretty much every aspect of the game felt during this beta.

----
The most concise way I can put my opinion is: What I played is a ""4.5 out of 10"" game I could see myself spending 10 bucks on and a week later regretting the purchase."
"I kept getting skinny Paul Giamatti and got so tired of looking at that face. Only one time I figured out how to change the guy. 

Only got to level 4 or five but with exactly the same impression."
They actually removed suppression lmao what the hell DICE?
"ye thats bullshit and explain why they nerfed sniper,

tbh I rather to see pea shooter machine gun with suppression effect rather than laser machine gun that can mow down people at long range fight."
It’s very obvious they wanted a warzone clone at the expense of a traditional battlefield game.
"When I heard that all environments were destructible I thought it was going to be like bf bad company 2 when you can noob-tube a whole house down.   
When playing the beta you can only implode walls, not whole structures excluding the rocket. kind of underwhelming. I am hoping this changes in the actual release."
There were so few structures I'm glad you couldn't level them. Too much open space on that map and if other maps are similar it's gonna be rough going for infantry.
I like the concept of leveling a while building to rubble like in Shanghai
"DICE has all pieces to this puzzle they just don’t know were the fuck to put them. This game has tons of potential but they need to fix: 

1. Add different uniforms for specialist when they are Russians or Americans
2. Flying system/controls
3. Visual bugs
4. Specialist should mixed with the previous class system. Class specific specialists is my idea
5. The UI its not that bad in my opinion, but make more similar to bf4/bf3
6. For the love of God fix sniping, make snipers sound more powerful and increase bullet  velocity, but not to much.
7. Granade notifications 
8. The plus system should be more limited. Limit the gadgets to suppressors, 2 sights, and 1grip attachment.
9. Make the IU to contrast a little bit more with the color pallet, that way is more visible. 
Add a leaning system like in bf4
10. Rename C5 back to C4
12. Increase recoil in weapons a little bit
11. Add the ability to increase the Mini map and a scoreboard at the end.
12. I don’t mind the hit makers but if I could change them I would.
 
PD: I’m still hopeful this game will turn out great. Its been disappointing in some areas but still has potential. I also think that Orbital is a bad map that highlights the problems with the game. If we had a more balanced map they wouldn’t look as bad. 

If you think I missed something pls go ahead a tell me."
"Honestly had a pretty nice time. I agree with all of the reports of bugs and quality of life stuff. I did have a hard time telling who was on which side. 
My biggest thing was I tried playing medic for a while, using the med box and reviving and my biggest complaint is the fact that revive is the same button as picking up weapons. I wanted to throw my controller so many times after the fourth or fifth time I swapped my gun while trying to revive. It made me feel bad too cause it makes it look like I’m just trolling the dead guy. 
Overall, I had a nice time but I’m not planning on getting the game unless maybe that portal mode is good."
Never even got to play even tho I have ea play because they don’t recognize Xbox elite series 2 controllers
"Remember they had an extra year to develop the game that is missing plenty of gameplay features present in the previous iterations and they boustee that they are ahead of schedule. And don’t give me the whole, oh, but this was an old build etc. because if you would know that this version would do more bad than good then why not prepare a newer version then."
"The current build is still being worked on and probably not in a predictably playable state.  They knew this old build could run, so that’s what they used for the beta"
Completely forgot the open beta and was able to play four games on PS4 - well I have not expected a graphic fireworks due to this platform is  old but former Battlefields are looking somehow more alive. Teamwork which is the DNA of battlefield seems to be gone and I was not able to figure out how to spot and mark enemies. Due to my short testing I have the feeling that it is still too early for release and classes/specialists should be overworked. However due to my lake of a PS5 and I'm owning a Series X cross-progression is the only feature I look forward and that's really sad. Should I buy - uncertain and thinking to wait until mid of next year (depends whether friends buy it on PS5 or get myself a PS5 and play it together or buy the standard version for series X advance with the char there  and as soon friends are on PS5 to progress further there - I do not know  uncertain what's the best way is).
"Jets are completely broken: ( Xbox One X )
I have noticed that as a Jet Pilot the Flairs are completely inconsistent, i have flaired many times perfectly and still got hit from (mostly) Attack Helis.
On the Counterpart often Times The Jet Missiles dont hit Helis, even if they already flaired and do not try to dodge them, the Missiles simply miss.
I have also tried holding the Lock until the missiles reach the Helis, with the same Result. 
I have also proven this Problem, as most of the time ( as an Attack Heli Pilot ) Lock on Missiles hit Jets, even if they flaired correctly. Its just so dumb and i honstly felt bad for the Pilot bc it was so easy to dominate other Jets with the Attack Heli, wich should not be possible.
I sincerely hope that Jets get seriously looked into until Release."
Sounds like beta bugs that will be fixed in full release
"DICE could easily resolve the confusion regarding which players heal/replenish/repair by adding an icon above their head. BFV demonstrates that the player model doesn't matter as long as a symbol exists above nearby players to indicate what they have. The only concern I have about the specialist system is that it makes it too easy for players to skip out on the heal/ammo/repair class-types. As far as I'm able to tell, you could theoretically have an entire team of players that don't have medpacks, ammo crates or repair tools equipped and honestly, this would be fine but only if medical and ammo supply stations (from BFV) were in this game, but they're not, so how does DICE intend to resolve the disconnect here?"
"Played on a ps4 pro,the game looks nice, surprisingly so for old gen, but there was constant stuttering, could not tap fire,so gun control was impossible, aiming felt wrong, and it was really buggy, animations looked terrible and the movement felt like a considerable downgrade from bfv, overall did not have fun with it, u wanted to like it so bad, but i havent lost all hope."
"Enjoyed it overall, and will wait until it's released before I decide to buy. 

Things that bugged me was

\- No anti tank mines, hope these return in the full game

\- Slow bullets on Sniper. As with BF5, the sniper shots are super slow and feels wrong."
"lock gadgets to classes again, keep the weapons open"
"Where exactly is the future in this game?  20 years is a long time for technology.  I will admit I spent very little time in the beta, but I never felt like it was the future."
"Robot dogs!  Lmao

You can heal ppl with a literal gun.  

That's pretty much it"
"And I LOVE that!  
I would've hated if everyone would fly around with jetpacks and if every helicopter would be a fucking drone.  


I think they found a good balance between futurism and gameplay. I mean even the last DLC of BF4 had more futuristic stuff in it (railgun, hovering tanks, etc.)"
"The healing gun is just a replacement for throwing little boxes.  It works the same way.  You can run over heal bullets on the ground.  That is not really futuristic anyway.  Do you think we will be healing people with guns in twenty years?

Robot dogs have existed irl since BF4.

For a game in the desolate future, this was not futuristic.  I highly doubt anyone could place the setting accurately if they were not told when it was.

My view is that they are using ""near future"" as a way to justify design elements that are not great.  It is not really a realistic game or a fantasy game.  It is some vague future that does nothing."
"Well, tech doesn't advance like it used too. We're kind of hitting a stagnant point because we are having issues making things smaller/fitting more in the space we currently have. It's why processors aren't generational leaps like they used to be. So it makes sense that 20 years from now things aren't crazy different, makes even more sense with the dire climate crisis that occurs in the game."
"It lacks things that we have now and ""future"" stuff found in other games.  Sure, it is beta and not all content, but cod has featured heartbeat sensors for years and camera/locator grenades for years.

This future seems to lack imagination.  I did not expect drone battles with robots, but this was robot dog and cars from today.  Not really amazing in my opinion.

and as someone else pointed out, bf4 was more futuristic in the end of its life."
I think DICE was trying to convey how there may be a lack of innovation/resources with global economies collapsing and countries being torn apart in the story for the game. That stuff could definitely come later though.
"""Its 20 years in the future, but everything stagnated"" is a shitty way of saying, we didn't want to think of anything, so here is a modern shooter with a very limited difference.  Not even including the ""futuristic"" things we actually have today, IRL."
"And if things have stagnated so much and the world is collapsing, why are they launching rocketships to space?

Other the world is gone to heck games are not featuring rocket launches. Nothing works in them and they use old stuff because the lack the infrastructure to build new stuff."
"I was able to get the game to run at Low settings to manage 60fps *most* of the time. I doubt they'll able to do some miracle optimization to make it run just a bit smoother, and finding new cards these days are pain."
"Don't lose hope, DICE is usually pretty good at delivering good perfomance in it's games...  
I guess the bad servers (i mean the rubberbanding and lags showed it..) plus the 2 months old version of this game could have been resulting in worse performance. Especially with 128 players.   
I had not many problems performance wise, but the FPS is really bad compared to BFV, even though the graphics looked worse in some places. I also only had like 60-80 fps compared to 120 in BFV..."
*cough* BFV *cough*
I have nothing against specialists but adds specialists for enemy team also... the same kinds just disrupts enemy/ally....
"WE NEED A CTE! 

that needs to be the reward for pre-order not a day of beta. let us help you..."
"Two things I'm not seeing mentioned a bunch is that some of us could never make the drone descend through the entire beta and repairing aircraft from the passenger seat was really really inconsistent. It'd work, then be impossible for a while, then randomly start working again."
Drone decent button was shared with your soldier crouch (hold) keybinding for some stupid reason.
The lack of aim assist on Console made the game plain unfun. No recoil AR’s only further give the advantage to M&K.
ARs had plenty of recoil both on console and PC?
"Yeah but it was almost straight up and down, super easy to control didn’t even really need to burst fire at range"
What's M&K?
Mouse and keyboard
I  bet this stuff why they made portal. Watch everyone play that and not the new stuff.
Or... Portal is going to be another Firestorm. Could go either way at this point.
"Unlikely. It's a mode where the community and devs get to set the rules, not middle management. Why would it flop?

Don't like specialists? Gone.

Don't like the hyper fast play? Increase the ttk.

Just want bf4 on new graphics? Done.

And so on."
"While I agree Portal may be a better opportunity for people to ""play by their rules"" so to speak and cater more to what they want, there is still a lot left to be shown. Beyond the few showcases of the game mode and what DICE has described (which doesn't amount to much) there's not much else to go on.  

In my opinion, if the base game is bound to flop, Portal won't save it. In fact, I doubt its really the big draw that DICE is trying to sell it as. I see Portal being like a knock-off of Overwatch's Workshop mode at best. It'll be fun for a couple hours but what will happen is only a select few game sets/modes will become popular, those modes will become dominate in Portal and people will get bored of them quickly.

Given the previous two BF titles failed to capture an audience for their new , non-base game modes (BFV Firestorm and BF1 Incursions), I doubt Portal will be anything spectacular. Fun for a bit, but not worth paying full price just for it."
"Did everyone get the survey from EA yesterday? They asked questions directly about the feedback from the beta: bugs, player visibility, time to kill, time to die, team play, UI, reaction to specialists, balance between specialists, time between objectives, the impact of weather events on gameplay etc. 

The survey was actually pretty good and asked the right questions. Really curious to know if they are considering making some big changes and even pushing out the release. I’m guessing it’s too late but the survey made it seem like they were pretty scared of the negative feedback from the beta and wanted to act on it."
Nope. I didn't.
Do you have a link of the survey?
Won’t work for you I’m afraid
"Damn, hope I'll receive one as well."

I just think being in some of the vehicles can be laggy. That is my only complaint
"I played on XBOX One and their was literally not one thing that worked as intended. The hold to lock AA missile gets thrown away on the last shot before you can hit your target. I’d don’t like the lack of classes or the gun attachments changing mid life. Not only are all classes homogenised into one, but now builds for your gun are also made into one as all players carry all attachments at once."
"Please Portal, save all of us OG's"
Using Hip Fire weapons like SMGs requires knowledge of your fire rate mode at all times but they made that info only available when you scope in. They need to change that.
"So in the light of this depressing beta, should I try Squad or Insurgency until Battlefield's identity crisis is over and they finally remember what drew us to Battlefield in the first place?"
"Well it made my entire discord group reinstall 4 again so not everything's bad

out of 16 people 3 found it *playable*"
"I've been playing BF since BF 1942 and this is easily the least fun one, so I played 3-4 hours and that was already more than enough for me.

Hard to pinpoint it to a single reason.

 First the UI is way  too crowded with the class, specialization and heros set up. Needlessly complicated to switch and change things in a quick manner. 

Then, the hero system simply delutes and neutralizes the effective BF formula that lead to it's success and allowed DICE to experiment with funky stuff like the hero system and what not. It simply has no place in BF. Don't mess with the fundamentals too much. Doing so will have an adverse effect on a franchise, which will lead to the  franchise taking a nosedive from a sales and financial POV. Take a look at the halo franchise after 343 industries took over. It went from being a massive cult franchise and frontrunner for Microsoft Studios/Xbox to being on its death bed now within years. The only reason that's not happening to BF is because DICE is competent and has way more experience, but if the trajectory is kept the same and it will eventually lead to this as well.

I don't like the gunplay either. I'm not sure if it was my ping, but either the guns spray way too much, with  the assault rifle needing the enemy to be 20-30  meters away at most  if you intend on hitting anything, let alone killing anything. On the other hand the LMG barely sprays AND has a bigger magazine. The learning curve for guns is non existent and the guns simply feels unsatisfying to shoot to put it simple. Revert back to Bf3 or Bf5 for gun mechanics for future titles. Also no auto aim, is an extremely questionable decision for console players, just like with the Halo: Infinite beta, especially against PC players.


How is it possible the that visuals look worse than Bf5? I played this on the ps4 pro and I know the ps4 pro life time has reached its end in terms of capabilities, but the logic dictates that the a newer game shouldn't have objectively worse visuals than its precursor.

I was excited for BF 2042, but after playing it I was very underwhelmed. Every modern based BF feels like an extended patch for BF3, which isn't a bad thing, as I said as long as the fundamentals are adhered to which makes BF fun in a unique way that other shooters don't offer. However, BF 2042 seemed rather uninspired with a forced twist to it (heros) to make it seem it's completely new. It's rather bland with uneffective additions."
"""The UI is too cluttered.""  


I'm sorry what? A single bar along the bottom of your screen where you click each section to change what's in it, then use an in game menu + to customize the gun once picked? Battlefield 4 has you literally jumping to another menu outside the spawn map selecting multiple tabs and drop downs to switch gear."
"Its just counter intuitive in comparison to other BF games. It  doesnt flow as good, especially with a controller. UI critism is obviously more on the nitpicky side and no deal breaker like the other points."
"For me the fire spread was the opposite: I was running with a LMG and it felt like an Assault rifle, I could just run, slide and shot. Most of the time the other player were saved by the awful servers"
"> I was running with a LMG and it felt like an Assault rifle, I could just run, slide and shot.

That's what I meant. It was essentially an assault rifle with the same spread but bigger magazine. So basically making the AR redundant, atleast as it was in the beta."
I'm gonna skip this game unfortunately. I didn't even feel like I was playing Battlefield
"A quick sum up:

\- Is there any use of being in a squad anymore? Unless for spawn points?  

\- If I don't need to fight hard to get that special scope, weapon... I'll stick to the ""best one"" and that's it... I hope this is temporary and you won't get all load out on day one.  

\- Why would I play Medic if I can have a rocket launcher instead?  
BF was fun and teamplay oriented, you didn't have a rocket launcher, but your buddy did, and the other guy had ammos. Enough to try to eradicate a tank.  

\- Dice, you can get rid of the revive sequence, nobody uses it. I remembre a time when you thanked your team mate for a revive. Now, sorry mate but look at that Bazooooka.  

\- How do I know I'm me and not the guy from the opposite team since we are copycats?  

\- Plus, this would be ""fun"" in hardcore mode...


Didn't preorder, a policy I have since a couple of years, will probably stick to BF1 or BF4 and buy the next MW if I want this kind of game..."
"this 100%  


Not one, or two but literally all the things that made BF BF - gone. Massive L imho  


Fortnite & COD had a baby and its bf2042"
"I really wanted a shooter that didn’t feel like Cod or Apex and I thought this might be it. Instead of focusing on what made battlefield different to those games, it seems to me like DICE decided to try and be just like them. Besides the obvious performance and optimization issues on PC; they removed what made battlefield fun to me and that was the classes. No medics, assault, recon classes? Why? I had a hard time distinguishing enemies from allies. Are the models too small? The audio was terrible. This game just felt rushed to me, like they had to put something out before the holidays. Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing in its current state."
"I was underwhelmed. Buggy, with only a month before launch. I’m sick of paying full price to be QA for gaming studios. I cancelled my pre order, will check back in on the state of the game post launch."
"It's not a Battlefield game anymore. It's Apexfield: Warzone heroes. Movement is too fast and arcadey, no teamwork, this new heroes/class system allows you to create one man army builds and just play deathmatch. But graphics and weather are beautiful, and I can have some soulless dumb fun, so I will buy it after with huge discount. But no preorder, no gold editions, no battlepass and no MTXs for EA. Just make a good Bf game and I will throw cash at you, but not today."
BF5’s on the menu boys
"Guys, if you want the battlefield experience get Hell Let Loose. All I can say lol."
"And if you want any semblance of teamwork with non-friends, get Insurgency."
"Need to try Insurgency again, has it gotten lots of love?"
I’m not sure about Sandstorm bc I only have the original 2014 one but there are still servers up and running!
Do you know if HLL will be adding airplanes at any point? That would be amazing
They probably will but it's an indie team so they are taking things one step at a time.
"Went in really hyped and had such a tough time playing due to bugs and poor optimization that I downloaded BF5 and am having a blast.

So... netpositive I guess.

Also as someone new to BF5, I am pleasantly surprised considering all the negativity I had heard about the game for the last few years."
Most BF games are like fine wine. Currently playing BF1 after the horrendous 2042 beta and I'm having a blast.
"BF5 is night-and-day now compared to its release. It is wonderful to play today and is a solid BF, but my lord was it baaaaad at launch. Can only hope BF2042 is delayed to avoid a garbage launch or it is going to be a wait for a pretty heavy sale for me."
"Haha, do you remember the TTK update? I uninstalled V instantly until they a week later reversed all changes.

I wonder if the manager that approved that, is somehow still around. Would explain a lot."
"Clearly a massive influx of CODkiddies 

No idea the fkn stress we went through for BFV 

Clearly new, Bur der germ dern werk is broken der



###BETA"
Seriously- this thread is full of people that are younger than a couple of cumsocks I have in the back of my garage.
"Can we talk about how awful the settings menu is? I don't understand how anyone designs a UI like this:  
  
-The settings have options, like OFF/ON.  
-BLUE = Selected State  
-BLACK = Non-Selected State  
  
But if you hover over a setting to change the toggle, the colors SWAP. So if you have a setting set to ON/BLUE, and you put your mouse over it to adjust it, the OFF button is now BLUE, which normally would indicate that it is ON. Atrocious design. Example of scrolling through it:

https://i.imgur.com/rZbiUao.png"
"Yeah noticed that too. Generally, the UI color compisition is terrible."
Yeah made me change settings incorrectly and took me a good minute of staring at it to work out what's going on.
"I also noticed that if you held left-click to change a slider, but accidentally moved the mouse verticially, it would start moving the entire menu. I'm guessing it's so that you can scroll the menu by clicking anywhere, without having to specifically click the scroll bar. I don't know why they couldn't just let people use mousewheel like a normal game ffs..."
"Whole UI team should be fired for making this abysmal ""UI""."
"The 2042 beta was a bit of a shitshow, game honestly felt like it could use another year of love and polish. Decided to buy the BFV Definitive Edition for 5 bucks instead. Much better deal."
That sounds like an excellent deal haha. Love bfv. Hope you enjoy it!
"I really don’t like how they made the game more “COD-like” if that’s a term, it just doesn’t have the same feel as a battlefield game, the “tactical sprint” the specialists, the gun mechanics, ect. 
Battlefield’s gameplay and feel was unique and set it apart from cod and other FPSes, sad that DICE just copied elements/trends.

I also don’t like the helicopter flight mechanics, feels very much like you’re on rails and not in full control of the helicopter, aiming helicopter guns was extremely difficult because the reticle didn’t adjust to your movement like it did in bf4, and using countermeasures on all aircraft was confusing and not exactly clear like how bf4 was.

Also, wtf was wrong with the graphics? Compared to battlefield one, a 5 year old game. The plants were kinda shitty, the water looks like shit, the animations seemed lower quality, and the lighting was just wrong.

Overall, battlefield 2042 seems quite disappointing."
"Disappointment and not worth the wait. Will be refunding soon, thanks for killing my love for battlefield. I was hoping for an improvement over Bf4 but this shit looks like warzone with more vehicles"
[已移除]
"Agreed, specialists ruin it. There's no point in medics because it's shit so everyone respawns on obj rather than on sqauds and that just means half the obj are camped by one team the other half camped by the other team."
"Honestly DICE just needs to remove specialists at this point. Like it's already very bad. Imagine a week after release. A month. The class system worked. It wasn't always perfect but at least it did work.

Fundamentally the class system was the linchpin that held the series together.

2042 seems to actively punish players for trying to work as a team. Ammo? Ammobox is basically mandatory meaning you have to prioritize yourself. Reviving people? Takes a long ass time."

In what way does the core gameplay not exist?

"The movement system feels odd. Like why tf is sliding in a battlefield game. Sliding and grappling around like a monkey belongs in arena shooters and If i wanted to play COD or Apex sliding and bunny hopping i would play those games. It is like the Devs want to appease to a new generation but in doing so they kicked the BF fans in the teeth who funded and kept this franchise alive for more than 2 decades. 
The specialist system should be reworked  or outright removed and replaced with the good old class system. Its like he BF Devs saw that hero shooters was the trend and decided to jump on its dick to capitalise as much as they can. 

Not buying on launch or possibly never ecause this looks to be another disappointment especially the specialist system which will bring about a ton of balancing issues down the line. 

Thank fuck BF4 still has a dedicated community. All they had to do more give us BF4+ on a new engine. 

If it ain't broke don't fix it."
"Sliding was in Battlefield since BF1, and that was 5 years ago. IMO the sliding in BF1 and 5 is very fun but I do agree that it was broken in this beta."
Yes sliding was BF1 was present in BF1 but there it was done right and was in short burst. Here in the beta the slide is something out of COD or Apex
[刪除]
"Kicking fans in the teeth = the specialist system and the overly fast paced movement system. 

Don't cherry pick what i said and read the whole thing"
[刪除]
Its true and not extreme. They are changing the fundamentals of the series and making it closer to any other popular series. In other words ruining it.
"It's a complete shift from the usual core features expected from the fans, that will feel like a kick for some players. Nothing extreme about it lol."
Never thought i’d seethe day where i prefer the mediocrity of COD over BF
"Same, and it hurts me to say it"
"I think if COD was releasing anything other than Vanguard this year they would clean up hard given the mess BF2042 is turning out to be. 

However Vanguard, however competent, is a fairly uninspired and generic title. Modern Warfare 19 was incredible, Cold War was alright but a step back, but Vanguard...meh."
vanguard is trash but i enjoy cold war
"Went and decided to get the early access. Only played for one night. Ran terribly, didn't pull me into wanting to play more, and it felt *off*. If the base game is this jank, I really wonder what HZ is looking like. No wonder they haven't shown any of it yet."
"It pains me to admit, but I was disappointed. I know it's a beta but it's supposed to be out in a month and I just don't think it's ready. The HUD is a headache in and out of vehicles. The specialist issue goes without saying. I do like the movement and how the guns feel. The bones of a Battlefield game are there, I just hope they don't take too long fixing things if they release it on schedule. Also didn't help that I'm a Rush player, so I'd really like to try that (or whatever it's now called?) before buying."
"Loved pretty much everything that is coming , exept for the specialists. The one thing that sort of tried to make people play together was the class system , now everybody is a 1 man army with the specialists, please bring back the class system and let the specialists just be a cosmetic skin as it should have been..."
"Hear hear. Although the specialists needs different camo for different nations. If not, then specialists need to be locked to certain nations.

But yeah. Last night after playing BF2042, we went back to playing BF1. If I need health, I quickly scan my surroundings for the closest medic. If I need ammo, I look for the closest support. Not saying that people playing those classes are always selfless - but with it being a conscious choice of picking the *medic class*, the average player is more likely to be aware of his duty as that class. When everyone is just running around and picking specialists based on looks or gadgets (which, apart from Falck, have no impact on teamplay or what role you can fulfill), everyone just seems to be playing for themselves. Everyone is the hero. I hate it."
"I agree, I could play as the assault character, use the grappling hook to get to high places / manuveur, equip a sniper rifle and use a medic crate to heal myself.  What is the point of using a sniper or medic class?

Previously, you could become a medic to help a moving squad move through to an objective and it was fairly rewarding to help out the team, at least in my experience through BF3.  Same thing with a support class.  Also with weapons being locked to specific classes you had more of a change up in style with each weapon.  Here I feel like I never need to touch any of the other classes since they all feel the same, and the grappling hook is pretty much the easiest to use.

Edit:  Also, I have no need to heal or give ammo, as, at least in this level and in the beta everyone was just running around alone, no squad movement or teamwork in sight."
The medkit and ammobox should be tied to a specific classes/operators same with the rocket launchers! Flying a chopper was pain in the ass just because every... single... second there was someone locking me as a target. Little things like these could make the game more enjoyable.
"![gif](giphy|qs6ev2pm8g9dS)

A lot of things were “turned off” for the beta just remember that on release 😂"
"While the demo (on Series S) wasn't bad, I also could tell pretty quickly this wouldn't be hold my interest for long. This was more or less Battlefront 2042. I'd be happy with a port of Battlefield 2 to the consoles at this point."
"Someone pointed it out for me and I think the scale of combat is really odd, I don’t know what scope to use if I use a red dot then it only works when the person is right in front of me, if I use a 2x+ scope then it takes ages to scope in and it’s just weird finding the right range for everything… maybe I just need to play more idk"
"As many here state, the specialist system effectively kills teamplay and player recognition.
 Everyone just plays for himself...
I can't believe they've abandoned a core Battlefield feature such as classes."
"Technical issues aside, the beta suffered from pretty much exactly the problems I was expecting: 

* Gunplay felt great, but... 
   * only in close range, because the damage dropoff and bullet travel time felt super random. 
   * only if the servers were running perfectly, as any bit of lag would make it far worse. 
   * it's balanced around duels, which will be a major problem when facing more than 1 or 2 enemies, and making it outright impossible to beat any decent squad 1v4, even if you get the jump on them. 
* Movement felt like a straight downgrade from BFV. 
   * Why remove crouched sprint? 
   * That new, second sprint, feels completely useless... 
   * Removing vehicle animations is objectively bad gameplay design.   
No matter how many people dislike them - not having them not only makes the game inherently janky, but also is a direct and unnecessary buff the the player that's already in a superior position (has/had a vehicle) to their opponent in the situation. 
* Autoheal is fucked 
   * Autoheal and -reload for vehicles is a terrible design choice, making the vehicles have no downside and denying any group that can't instantly kill them 0 downtime. 
   * Players heal way too quick, removing any reason to bring heal gadgets for your squad 
   * Just bring back attrition and improve on it ffs... 
* Operators feel super tacked on. 
   * They dont fit the rest of the game which makes them seem like a cheap ploy to squish more money out of players. 
   * WHY THE FUCK DOES EVERYONE LOOK IDENTICAL???   
Oh yeah right, so that people buy MTX... 
   * Their tools are also horrendously unbalanced in a way that can't necessarily be fixed with number tweaking. 
* Gadgets felt weird AF. 
   * Being able to bring but one severly hinders your adaptation options and teamplay potential. 
   * Also, why is there a fucking armor gadget that not only straight up gives 0 squad value, but also seems super fucking strong? 
   * AV gadgets seem to do very low damage, especially to tanks, especially if you bring but one. 
   *  Half of any Conquest matches playerbase will always be COD-ing around the Kiddie Objectives. Adding The body armor and grappling hook just makes this worse, as you're straight up stronger for having them. 
* The Radio is cute 
* Swapping weapon attachments in-game is a neat idea and technically impressive, but it's gameplay is horrendously lame for the most part. It's a classical min-max thing. You'll want the best possible setup for any situation.
   * Either you're forced to constantly swap your setup because it's too impactful not to, making the entire system but a lame chore... 
   * Or the system is too impactless to matter, and just a weird little gimmick making weapon customization unnecessarily complicated and limited. 
   * Most of the utility is already available in literally just toggling the attachments. Taclight? Shut it off. Zoom levels? There's sights you can toggle... 
   * The one part that's justifiable to have and a sidegrade instead of a area-specific upgrade is the AP-Bullets, and maybe the sub-barrel grenade launcher. 
   * This system also costs dev time to develop and maintain, and it wil very likely continue to limit weapon customization options - why else can we not equip a grip and a taclight simultaneously? 
* 128 players is too much for Battlefield's metagame. 
   * Even 64 already lead to zergfests more often than not, and adding even more just made the chaos worse. 
   * You have almost 0 impact on the game as a player or squad, especially as infantry. 
   * You can barely get from one point to the other without  running out of bullets from enemy encounters. This wouldn't be that much of a problem if spawns or frontlines were more predictable, or infantry would pose more of a threat to vehicles to create pressure - but as of now, the area between objectives is pure chaos and a heli farming kills. 
   * You can hardly attack objectives without zergs because there's just too many players able to spawn 
* Why is there 3D spotting and how does it work? 
   * Does it work? 
   * Does it not? 
   * Why do i get to spot a rando sniper 2km back sitting behind a bush, but i can't mark the Tank right infront of our attack chopper? 
   * Callout system is neat tho - shame noone else hears it??? 
* The HUD is pretty bad. 
   * It's graphically convoluted and hard to read 
   * Borderline unusable already, but when you get into a hazard zone like the tornado's, it becomes terribly distracting, too 
   * Ontop of that, I feel lied to when I have to search and browse menus for important stats because some suit decided ""displaying their death counts will discourage players"".    
You're not the customer, you're the product. 
* The tornado itself is about as interesting and impactful as expected.   
I feel like if DICE/EA dropped the ""Big Wow Gimmick"" Marketing schemes, they could far more easily (or at all) focus on improving the actual game. 
* Teamplay seems to be actively discouraged beyond zerging. 
   * Why are we back to 4 man squads? Especially now with more players and less tools per? 
   * Gadgets are weird 
   * Weapon damage is too low and TTK way too high to take on larger numbers of enemies. 
   * There is 0 reason to bring any heal gadget 
   * Your squad doesnt matter 

Overall, it plays like BF5.2 with some future-paint and more chaos slapped on, but without the interesting mechanics that game introduced at launch.   
Feels like a downgrade even, in quite a few ways... 

&#x200B;

Guess we'll wait for what the game will become in a year or so, but I have little hope considering what was done to BFV, and how EA treats their other IPs.   
I'll probably have to continue waiting for another IP and studio to offer a fun a mix between Arcade and MilSim, and instead buy that when it comes out."
">Why do i get to spot a rando sniper 2km back sitting behind a bush, but i can't mark the Tank right infront of our attack chopper?

Because there is NO ""3D spotting."" The spotting of the sniper is the (broken) ""ping"" system working and showing your ""danger!"" as the actual threat. You can do the same with the ""tank"" but since tanks move, you get a ""<name> called out tank!"" notification on the kill-feed area and that's it.

&#x200B;

The Ping system alone already soured me on the game, I hated it in the last outing, and I hate it here."
"I know about the difference in spotting and ping system.   
The sniper was definitely spotted and marked with a red icon, possibly even outline. Happened with tanks too, sometimes - but neither reaction was reliable"
"I disagree about 128 players not being great. Hell I wish it would be higher! 

The problem is there isn’t much front lines in the current maps. BF1 maps for exemple were greats because they were designed for a team to defend and another to attack, creating frontlines."
Needs more tanks for such a large map
"Ended waaaay too soon. Got home late from work last night, poorly planned. Now on the game play definitely the Beta version, gunplay felt tight, movement mechanics felt good, servers seemed to hold out okay which is the big test. A few cosmetic fixes especially when people do Hardcore are neeeeeded. The plus system saved my ass a few times, can't wait to see what all is tweaked come full game. Hopefully we can swap the button for Plus and Grenade because Up for grenades is ugly."
"I thought it was ok. It seems like a good game, but not a good Battlefield game."
"Loved the beta. Very excited for release. My comments:

- Not a fan of specialists. Really discourages team play. People pick selfish load-outs. Need to be able to distinguish teams. There needs to be more incentive to help your team. That’s really why I prefer battlefield over other shooters. 

- Refine how to help your teammates. Reviving is too slow. I don’t know who has what. How do I get ammo? Who can give it to me? I’d like to be able to grab it off support players.

- Gunplay felt great. I hope the rest of the guns are well balanced. DMR felt a little out classed by the assault rifles. I thought the sniper was fine. I heard a lot of people complaining it was underwhelming. Any better and I feel it would be overpowered. 

- I don’t think armor plates should be there. Maybe in other modes but not the base game.

- Movements need work. Seems a hair too fast. A lot of slide and AD spam. I don’t have the best aim but it just seems like a bunch of people running around in circles like chickens with their heads cut off. 

- Helicopters feel untouchable. They are too fast to hit, and the infantry AA missile felt useless against them. I maybe hit a helicopter once with one. I kept getting absolutely stomped by helicopters. Tanks and jets I felt were fine though."
"The sniping is worse than BF4.

So by your comments BF4 sniping is overpowered?  Then BF1 it must be straight up cheating.

Btw I feel like sniping in BF4 is harder than every other gun class.  Yet I main it because I hate myself.

But I'd be happy if they buffed it to BF4 levels so that im just at a disadvantage and not a crazy disadvantage.

Im on controller, which a mouse would definitely make it easier.  But no mouse support for consoles.  Which is wild.  We can face mkb, but we can't use them because fuck us lmao."
"BF1 they went for a more realistic muzzle velocity altough i don't thinks realistic is even the right word because of how little compensating for drop you had to do even in long distances. BF4 really felt for me like you are shooting pellets with every gun because of how slow the bullets for most guns are and to make situations worse, they don't even put one of the most interesting gun statistics of the game as info you can easily access. Still liked BF4 though even with that, broken thermal and littlebirds."
"Sniping is subjective. Depends on who you ask.

I’d rather it be more difficult, and I prefer that the snipers be more involved and get drawn in closer to the fray rather than hang out on the edge of the map with a high powered optic. 

A little buff would be fine, but I didn’t find it overly difficult to use, so I think they’re in a good spot.

BF1, I wouldn’t go that far, but I was not a fan of the sweet spot mechanic. Fun to use but not on the receiving end. BF4 sniping was great."
"Im an aggressive sniper.  Not a camper.  I actually rush and push with the sniper.  Which results in alot of deaths.  But I do take ranged shots when need be.

https://youtu.be/kBhzeZvAnHk

I want them to be hard to use.  Just not laughably unrealistic bullet drop.   A buff to BF4 levels is absolutely fine with me.  BF1 levels are too much."
"Im ok with the plates for a future battle royale mode, but yeah, not base game."
"C5 throwing distance needs a massive nerf. It’s a several pound bag of explosives, you shouldn’t be able to throw it 10-15 meters."
"Played every BF until V, for near 20 years BF has been my primary source of FPS goodness, and I won't be purchasing this one as I feel it falls too far away from the core features that made Battlefield what it is for me and that's teamwork. I'll be waiting until post launch to see what bugs they fix and if any of the things I don't like were changed, but they seem far too fundamental to this iteration to change."
CoD ground wars is more Battlefield than Battlefield
"Cancelled my preorder after playing for couple of hours. I wasn't a fan of BF4 and COD to start with. Since developers decided to mix both of them, this game is clearly not for me :) Will pick up from discounted shelf sometime next year maybe.
PS: I'm so happy game doesn't have woman with prosthetic arm this time 😂"
All Bugs aside.. This battlefield feels like a free game. Why are we paying full price for free game experience with no campaign. I only had 2 hrs recorded on steam. Also so much is going on the screen it's kinda distracting.
"Coming from someone who started and played the living hell out of Bad Company 2, I literally had to cancel my pre-order. I don't believe a word of what was said on that being a old version release or not. The game will release close to, if not exactly in the same state in November. R.I.P. to the Best fps franchise...Truly breaks my heart..."
"I’m so bummed. Bad company 2 was my first and favorite shooter as a kid and then BF3 was my entire life for a while. After going sideways and slightly downhill with BF4, kind of recovering with BF1, then nosediving into the concrete with 5 I was hoping this would be the game to bring it back to the good old times. Instead they have killed my baby for good and mangled it’s body in a horrific way. 
RIP Battlefield"
"Why in this day and age would anyone pre-order, especially a BF game? When have you ever walked into a store, or logged into Steam/Origin and not been able to buy a game?  Games dont sell out anymore, and most of the time its a digital download.  

Games like this will take months to smooth out, save some money and some anguish and wait for the product to settle.  The only reason I ""pre-ordered"" was because it came with the 3070 Ti that I bought.  My expectations are low on release day.  Vote with you wallet."
I personally came from the era of mid-night releases especially Bad Company 2 when there was literally no lines because it wasn't up there with MW2 yet. Battlefield was the last franchise I wouldn't think twice if I should pre-order or not. After that Beta it cut the last pre-order string for me. I truly feel bad for the Devs who have to deal with these publisher's and their detached expectations...
"I get it.. I played the original demo of BF 1942 and was blown away with how ""massive"" it was, but the gunplay back then sucked, especially when you only had Quake to compare it to.  BF2 was pretty ambitious at the time with the commander role, and that took time to balance out.  BF4 was a total shit show.  Mainly due to it being released between PS3 and PS4, and they had to make it for 5 different platforms.  I was gutted with how poorly it performed, but a year later, and a ton of love from Dice LA, the game was my favorite BF experience yet.  Now we have BF2042, 1 year after Xbox/PS5 hardware releases while supporting all the previous generation and it feels like BF4 all over.  Hopefully this gets better post game support than BF5 did.  If it gets supported like BF4 did, then we'll be ok.

As far as pre-orders go, the only publisher I'd consider pre-ordering now days would be Nintendo.  How often do they have to spend a month or two of patching before their games are usable?"
It's probably going to be exactly what happened with BF4 but possibly even worse with the mutiple hardware differences. Everyone who decides to stick it out with this new battlefield will ultimately be beta testing the whole time. Such a shame to see this Franchise turn into every other franchise with these ridiculous practices...
Only reason I had fun was because of the people I was playing with.
Yeah games like these become like 10x more fun with friends
"I will be sticking to BF4 and V, I won’t purchase this one. I really feel like this one is trying to appeal to the COD player and a younger audience. It felt like a mashup of Warzone and Apex and that’s not what BF is about. Also, Battlefield has always been praised for feeling cinematic, specially with BF1 and V but wtf is this game? It felt mediocre and it has lost the battlefield flair"
[Cinematic Flair Enough For You?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/q5f4yf/good_fucking_god/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
"This game will sell great with the part of the COD community that didn’t want WWII and aren’t happy with this years games. But based on my play time I can’t see it selling well or being enjoyed by the hardcore battlefield fans. The game just didn’t feel like battlefield to me. Movement was fast, specialists, vehicle handling was terrible. If I had pre ordered it I think I’d be cancelling. There’s no reason not to stick to BF4."
"As someone who plays just the Blackops COD games mostly, when it comes to COD. I usually just buy the Treyarch releases, and get a lot out of them. The others I usually pass on, Vanguard looks trash compared to Cold War where I’ll be staying. I did look at this, as my friend loves battlefield more. So I wanna take a chance, however I can’t say I liked the beta. Even as a moderate COD player. Sure it has the speed and feel…but I feel there’s games like war zone, Apex that do a lot of this with big maps for free with in game purchases. 

This game has no single player and is 69.99 on PS5. I was hoping for something not COD like, and a cool game honestly. But from the one level, I can’t really say I’m throwing my money at it. I’ll wait and see after launch, just because I have friends that are hardcore Battlefield players, buying day one. I want to play in a squad with my friends, but I’m not sure if this is a rushed game by EA. The price and what’s on offer, plus buying more season passes is pretty bold for an online only game with no single player in this day and age.

COD did something similar focusing on only Multiplayer, and that horrible BattleRoyal that ended up just being free at some point. I never felt so cheated buying a game as I did BlackOps 4. They came out and said they decided to focus on BattleRoyal and MP. But it turned into just rushed out crap imo. I felt really suckered by that game. So very cautious of online only shooters, full price with no campaign or story mode. Easily games that can be rushed out for profit. So I’m a little skeptical, being it’s EA who does Apex as well."
"I sadly cancelled my Pre-Order. 
I had a lot of hope for this game but I didn't enjoy a whole lot about the beta.

Still gonna hold onto hope that the full release will be good but I'll wait a week or so after release and get a good look before I buy it.

My biggest problem was how the game felt to play. It didn't feel like a battlefield game to me at all. The previous battlefield games have all had a distinct beefy feel about the mechanics of the game and this one feels very plastic compared. I know everyone is saying it but It really does feel like they've tried to make it more like CoD and one of the best things for me about Battlefield was that it was nothing like CoD."
how do you cancel preorders? I ordered from Origin and not that EAplay thing (whatever that is)
"I got mine through steam. Not sure about Origin, Steam are very good with refunds."
I got mine free with an NVME drive and I wish I could cancel it.
I’m just gonna say this to Dice and hope y’all listen. Delay the game 6 more months. I don’t care how long we have to wait. I want a great battlefield experience that can rival or excel what I had in BF3 and BF4. I don’t want an unfinished game on launch with features missing in this one that were already present in previous titles. Delay the game till it’s polished.
"I had alot of fun, the vehicles are alot weaker than BF4, especially the attack heli gunner, but they're still fun and considerably less overpowered.

I'm way more pissed about the constant lock-on beeping than i am about specialists, even though my ground to air ratio is probably 80-20

also, [https://i.redd.it/ft52cgojzhs71.png](https://i.redd.it/ft52cgojzhs71.png)"
[I completely agree about homing missiles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/q4qlku/dice_please_improve_2042s_air_combat/)
"they are weaker? I have seen people get 140 kill scores as the gunner.
The Gunners on the Attack Heli are straight OP if used right. (Not that in Bf4 they were balanced)
Because you dont need to reload like in Battlefield 4, you can outplay the Overheating Mechanic, by simply burst firing. Basically you have unlimited ammo without reloads and if bursted correctly you can fire as long as you want. Now thats what i would call OP."
"Reloading guns with the tacticool setup, I get its the trend to try and replicate Modern Warfare 2019's design, but this leads to reloading taking far too long in many situations. 

Modern Warfare allows you to speed up reloading, or allows you to load in extended magazines, but this isn't the case in battlefield. (except for I guess the vector) Taking down one or two players and having to run around a corner to reload for a long time leads to stale gunfights. 

Just regular sprint, tac spint, and vault animations seem to be a step downward. I understand that standing up from prone has used the same animation since Battlefield 3 across BF3, 4, 1, and V, but this animation does have a lot of character. You feel like a robot, and sure I guess there's the argument that in 2042, soldiers are going to be enhanced in a way, but this just loses some of the character. Battlefield 1 had some excellent weapon animation and design which is lost here. 

The introduction of Tactical sprint also doesn't really make a whole lot of sense here. Modern Warfare introduces this as a temporary boost to your speed for 2 seconds (or 4 with a perk) to allow quicker movement before returning to a normal sprint. It also has downsides like the time it takes between clicking down and actually shooting.

Battlefield's Traversal Sprint doesn't seem to have any downsides, and is infinite just like normal sprint, which means me wonder why it even exists. Just increasing the base sprint speed would be enough, it just doesn't seem to have a purpose. 

&#x200B;

My impressions are otherwise positive, but I definitely wanted to get these things off my chest."
Maybe it's meant to help you get across the huge map quicker? I don't know but I also hardly noticed the difference between tactical and regular sprint.
"I think others have covered the many missing features and poor decisions that have gone into this game, that I don't need to say anymore on that side.

Positively I like the vehicle system. Calling vehicles in is great, and a cool down timer for spawning in them is a great idea. I remember hovering around helicopter spawns to get a go in them, wasn't fun.

The new gunship is great fun, a helicopter that can take some damage opens up a lot of fun opportunities. I loved zooming up to the roof, dropping people off under fire, and being able to leave and come back again. Only complaint is we need to reduce the number of people with anti air rocket launchers. AA capabilities should be limited to one class and the associated AA vehicles.

The fire suppressent system going off in the warehouse is a nice new feature caused by destruction too."
Makes me grateful for halo’s release.
Fix the damage helis take from hitting the ground. Taking 40% damage from a tiny bump on the ground is stupid
Fuck man what a dumb ass time to end the beta
"The is potential for a good BF in it. Technical difficulties aside, I think that the gunplay is solid, coming from Apex Legends I like the faster movement. 

What I currently dont like is the scale issue that was discovered here on reddit. That is a really flawed design choise. Plus the absolut trash UI. And the character clones issue. 

Will be interesting to see if they somehow can upgrade the graphics, because it wasnt really looking like a Next Gen title for some reasons. Not that it would be a total dealbreakers but from feeling the past Battlefields looked better and more ahead of its time than 2042.

Will I buy it Day One after the Beta? Absolutly not! Will I keep track on updates and buy it later next year? Absolutly!"
Glad I didn’t pre-order. I’m only getting it through EA play pro since I also play madden and fifa. This game was really weird for me since I haven’t played a battlefield field game since 4 and kinda 5. I felt like I spent too much time running around instead of shooting
I played for about an hour and the ttk is atrocious.
I wholeheartedly disagree. The gunplay and dueling were the absolute best part of the beta. I single handedly cleared the rooftop on B in 1 magazine
"Something I haven’t heard people talk about is how poor the visibility is in first person vehicles. There’s like a dark blue tint that makes it hard to see and the crosshairs are a visual mess. 

Also with tanks on PC there’s no separate crosshairs for where you’re aiming vs where the tank is aiming. It’s feels really bad to try to turn your turret around in a tank. You have to lift your mouse up a few times."
Not only that but there's so much random crap flying around across the screen in first person. It made spotting infantry really difficult.
"In short, I liked it and had fun. As long as they fix the bugs and make some changes to the specialist system I’ll be a happy boy. Oh and the revive mechanic needs some changes as well imo"
"Welp, there goes another year of battlefield. And just like last time it’ll take until the next entry for the game to be good and fun"
Just remake Battlefield Bad Company and scrap this shit. We won’t tell anyone
"Fuck yes. Re-skin Bad Company 2 so people play it again, don't change the mechanics, and I'll pay $60 for it. My few hours in this beta was enough to convince me that EA still doesn't give a fuck about their player base."
"Did anyone else have the bug where the tall building at B wasn’t called B in the whole match and was called HQ instead? It wasn’t even listed as a capture point next to the minimap, it went A, C, D, E, F. We didn’t even know if capturing B/HQ was making any difference to the score. We wondered if we missed any significance to this being changed on some matches or it’s just a bug?"
"Yep I had that several times. Not only the tall building, but sometimes all objectives were called HQ. I think it's just a bug."
Haha I never saw that where they are all called it! I’m sure they will only have 50 bugs at launch as opposed to the 100 in the beta. I had fun with the game anyway and looking forward to it
Aim assist is broken on consoles they sorely need to fix this otherwise its just unplayable
I’m terrified to think about what if this was intended.
"First of all, I have to put out the disclaimer that I have not played any BF, nor any other online shooter since the early days of BF1. I was burned out of shooters after 4 years of BF3/4 and I wanted to also play a lot of the games I was missing out. So I came into the beta with your traditional BF expectations: plenty of bugs, but the mechanics should be up to par!

Overall, while I did enjoy the beta for what it's worth, I like many others, have quite a few issues with the game:

* Specialists have been discussed long and hard on here, I can only say that under the current implementation they bring absolutely nothing positive to the game. Let the classes be the main attraction, and if you really want specialists, just allow people to have access to one unique equipment slot/gadget. And for the love of God, make the skins unique as well! Everything else should be limited to a specific class.
* I'm not a fan of the plus menu. While I understand the philosophy behind it, I don't feel it matches the same ""realistic"" vibe that BF games always had as all of a sudden my soldier can carry of this equipment. I would much prefer a few caches around the map where you can go and change your load out. The UI can stay as it is imo, although I'm not sure how they will handle a huge list of potential attachments in such a UI design.
* Movement felt much faster than BF3/BF4. Took a bit of used to, and I understand that with such huge maps the running speeds to be higher, I just feel that the characters are not as physically connected to the ground as in past titles. Animations for vaulting etc. don't seem as well made as in previous games.
* I know we only got one map, but destruction is awful! Even metro, one of the shittiest maps for destruction in BF3, had more than this. While Caspian completely pumped me up for BF3, Orbital fails to do that (I do love the map design most of the time, expect the wide open space between D and E where it's very difficult to navigate on foot given how everybody else is higher than you).
* Spotting is gone?! And replaced by a ping system that doesn't seem to work that well at that??? The number of times I instinctively spotted someone only to get nothing was driving me crazy. I'm ok with changing the way things work, but at least allow for squad incentives. Presently, I have no idea how I can tell my squad/team where potential dangers are. Also, having to aim at a player for 1-2s before they're identified as a target (and this only works within a given range from what I could tell) is rather stupid. I have to wait to ID the guy if he's in range, and hope he doesn't shoot me first?
* I guess commo rose is just not in the beta? I can't believe it won't be in the full release
* Being a gunner in tanks/LAVs/trucks was quite bad. I've never had this much stuttering in a shooter. Not sure if this was because of people being on a different system or just overall server connection issues but having a smooth feed is crucial for a gunner. This was not at the case when I was the driver.
* Vehicles felt very floaty, similar feedback of sorts to what I mentioned about the characters. It's as if the gravity/weight physics implementation is off.

To be honest, I'll wait for the game to be out a few months to see how some of these things are handled. In it's current state, I won't buy it given that I have plenty of other games to play.

PS: Also, holy cow did it took me a long time to figure out how to revive. I was looking everywhere for the revival kit to equip it. They need to do a better job to highlight what each specialists has"
"Some guy here called this game the chinese version of battlefield and I coulnd't agree more. It feels like it wants to imitate battlefield but it fails in terms of delivery. Movement is too arcadish, the aim and gunplay in general feels weird and cheap, the new system of in game accessories is super imbalanced, the weapons first person perspective feel small and the animation feel like they want to get the same feeling of cod mw but without actually doing it. the specialists are just dumb and will only serve for mtx purpuses. I don't understand the obsessions in later games for the grapple hook: I can understand doom and halo as they are fast paced and arena games at their core, but in battlefield it only makes the experience more arcade and random. If I am, say, defending the lower stairs of the rocket point flag in orbital, who can stop any assault from jumping directly at my level or that above me and kill me without me even noticing? It literally kills the need for strategic positioning as every body can go everywhere without problems. No classes destroy teamwork, and vehicles feel very tedious to drive and ""floaty"". Also the nightbird is definetely op. Destruction is very limited, just like in bf4. The level design in orbital is quite weak: who thought that having basically half the map on the open without any type of cover was a good idea? Also taking down an osprey or a helicopter with a rocket launcher but realize that it was piloted by a bot was very depressing. Definetely not going to play at launch."
Bad imo. Played 3 matches and stopped. That‘s more warzone than BF. The HUD is too big - couldn’t tell who was a friend and who was the enemy.  Maybe it was the map but sometimes I had no idea what to do. I played on PS4 so not a ps5 but I expected more until I realized that itMs a 2-3 month old build. So maybe they changed a bunch of stuff and hopefull better the graphics especially for ps5/ series X users. Gameplay a big downgrade from BF5 which was amazing .
"I will not be buying this game at launch.

* The removal of classes and the addition of specialists is a poorly executed money grab that is nearly universally hated by everyone.  

* The graphics are an enormous downgrade from the last two Battlefield titles.

* The gameplay feels nothing like a Battlefield title, just a team death match on Call of Duty mashed up with some Apex legends. 

* If the one map we got to see was any indication, the maps in this game are all going to boring & uninspired. It isn't enough to say ""This Battlefield is going to have 120+ players!"" if all the maps are just going to be painfully large with vast spaces of nothing going on. 

* The entire interface and especially the scoreboard looks like something I would've cooked up in MSPaint in an hour when I was 12 years old and getting into graphic's design, it is actually embarrassing that someone both made the scoreboard and someone else said ""yeah this looks OK"" . (And the continual dumbing down of the stats we get to see each game)

I cannot overstate how disappointing this beta was. Even setting aside the ludicrous changes they've made to the core formula of the game, it feels like an unfinished mess that needs another year of development to be ready.

I might buy this when it's on sale for $20, it isn't worth a penny more than that. If it weren't for the removal of classes I would feel less critical, but it is obvious that the people in charge of development of this franchise are completely disconnected from what makes Battlefield what it is, and they're just chasing money-grubbing trends of more popular games, it is sad to see one of the game series of my childhood in this state."
"Did anyone else playing on PC feel like there was some sort of mouse acceleration?

I tried changing various settings and enabling/disabling raw input but nothing seemed to work. Aiming didn't feel as crisp and precise as in other games. There's something weird going on."
"Ok, I played on match and uninstalled it. 

Here's why: 
The graphics alone feel like a major set back. Upon starting the game you get a menu that's poorly constructed and looks almost exactly like the launch screen for Call of Duty. When you get into a match, the user interface is so bad I feel like a 12 year old with Adobe Photoshop could craft a better looking one. 

Looking past that, the fact that the operators are the same for both teams is just downright lazy and laughable. Speaking on operators, what's with the 79 year old woman?!?! Like I get it, inclusivity and all but...really???....anyways....you finally launch into the game and realize very quickly that this is no longer battlefield as we once loved it. The movement system is arguably an upgrade but it feels like a Great Value call of duty movement system. The guns feel weightless and lack the realistic recoil and movement that was present in every title up to now. 

The vehicles feel like their physics also received a downgrade, they used to be somewhat realistic movement-wise but now seem like Warzone vehicles. Like they're weightless but glued to the ground and don't want to be.

Revisiting the graphics, they look unfinished. The map showcased some things that are a major downgrade from V. Battlefield V felt lush, and full of entities (foliage, grass, details) this beta map reminds me of a Galore Forge map built with generic assets plopped on a map. 

Overall this Beta (yes, I know, it's a beta) was a major let down and shines light on the negative direction DICE is taking  Battlefield in. 

Low key, it feels like Tencent made it and not even Dice. 

/Rant"
"Felt disconnected from my character.  Felt zero interest in dealing with game design and software engineering failure upon failure stacking up upon itself in rapid succession, ruining any sense of enjoyment and making the rage come not from my actions, but the undeniable failures of the software.

Sound design is a failure.  Footsteps sounds are missing and broken, and distance attenuation is broken.

Vision design is a failure.  The magnified scopes are complete failures.  It's weird to acknowledge and confirm that DICE/EA have the undisputed worst scope zoom mechanics of any AAA fpp fps shooter. Line of site in vehicles is a failure and major downgrade from prior titles and expected/normal AAA competitor experiences.

The siloed automaton antisocial and anticommunity design is a failure.

The third person animations are failures.

The revive system is a failure.

The specialist class is a failure.

The armored vehicle viewports is a failure.

The UI/UX/CX was a massive downgrade from expected and normal AAA fpp fps experiences.  Maddening.

Honest opinion is the game is going to be in the discount bin by January 2022 if launched in this state.  No amount of paid advertising is going to be able to mask this myriad, immediate noticeable, and near all consuming state of failure.  

The tornado was pretty cool.

I didn't get more than like 3 or 4 minutes at a time without some massive bug or failed design system messing up the gaming experience."
"Can only echo the sentiments here a thousand times, but with the addition that 128 players is just way too much. At least for me, it makes it nothing but chaotic the entire time and your ability to contribute in any meaningful way goes out the window. There's just too many people, everywhere at all times. Take out a helicopter pilot with a great shot? Cool, new helicopter just showed up before the last one hit the ground and now you're dead.

It also means the average lifetime is so short that nobody focuses on team play since its more practical to play selfishly. You can try reviving teammates sure, but if 5 enemies are bearing down at you constantly you'll just die too. And why bother with a medic since most people die too fast to heal in the first place?

Will certainly be avoiding that mode."
Is it just me or does the console gunplay feel off?
"Yeah, same. Appatently aim assist is turned off for the beta. But still I got tremendous input lag, like half a second where nothing happens. Values for scopes are off, shooting and trying to manage recoil is a mess because of the input lag, everything feels so bad. I was hyped after being disappointed for so long by DICE but I guess it's time to move on. They won't cater to their older core gamers being about 30 anymore. BF is dead."
"Sometimes less is more. That's how I felt after playing this beta. I found myself missing the 12 v 12 rush mode from BFBC2 that was perfectly complimented by the map design and the rock/paper/scissors balance of the class system.   

This felt like a bunch of Metro map meat-grinder hot spots spread over a larger map. Moving between points was largely pointless, as by the time you'd hiked there it was too late. Was hard to read the flow of battle without a large map view. So I found myself just picking one spot to spend the entire round.  

If they want to win me back, and I suspect specialists are here to stay sadly, then show me some Portal gameplay of Arica Harbour Rush with 12 v 12, classic BF rules like only spawn on squad leader, and classic BF classes.   

You can keep this 128 player stuff. Planetside 2 did that way better. Because it had defined classes and roles to play into."
Maybe it’s just me but i feel like helicopters are a little too god.
"Do the operators make sense for this game?  I hate dying and seeing 4 grandma clones running around my body.

In its current state, the most ideal situation is 32 total grandma clones on the map, 32 borises, etc.

Blahhh..  I just want to be a badass generic soldier guy. :("
"DICE is trying to make inroads with the GILF/Gushing Grannies market. 

No matter how you feel about it, you gotta admits it’s a ballsy move!"
"I started out kinda not loving it, but it totally sucked me in once more people joined and got playing. It's absolute chaos on a massive scale and I love it. There are some thing I don't 100% love (e.g. lack of team cohesion) or were annoying (e.g. frame drops), but I'm chalking those up to the limitations of the beta. I didn't experience any crashes, anything game breaking, or anything that can't be ironed out later based on player feedback (like every other BF game).

Overall, I'm looking forward to the launch and digging into all the content they have planned for us."
The game is not ready.
why did it end on a Sunday ;;\_\_\_\_;;
"My BF2042 experience:

Can't progress through main menu wired or wireless x10 resets no other peripherals and magically it lets me in.

10 seconds in: 'controller disconnected'... it's wired...


Can't progress through main menu wired or wireless x5 resets no other peripherals and magically it lets me in.

Play for 1 minute

Turn up volume on sound system 'controller disconnected'... it's still wired...


Restart and a game.

Play one round, watch players levitating around map, parachutes never despawning. Shooting tons of core shots and not getting but 1:1 kd

Have to leave.

Come back, BETA IS OVER.

This is why I do not preorder games anymore, EVER.

Also this is alpha build levels of 'literally unplayable'.

Get your shit together."
Hugely disappointed. I always tend to wait until just before release until buying however all this Beta done was completely put me off the game.
"I was really disappointed in the no classes system the most and it felt like nothing like a BF title so I refunded.      
       
Steam had a bundle offer of complete BF1 & 5 for $9 so I bought that, I have been having a an amazing time in 5 so far and highly recommend it for BF style fans if you are disappointed in the direction of Warzone 2042."
It felt more Warzone than any Battlefield game. Run really shitty on ps4 pro and legacy(?) controller layout did not work. I looked like an idiot when I tryed to hit the floor and ended punching air. Oh and the weapon attachment system is stupid.
It ran shitty on my PS5 too.
I only had fun in this game when playing the little bird and the tank and im almost always a pure infantry player
"Didn’t get to play beta more than 5 minutes because of a bug, love it"
"Maybe im a little confused, but even if you preordered, you can no longer play beta?"
All gone. Like tears in the rain.
"Yeah first two days were early access to the beta if you pre-ordered, second two days were open to everyone. The last day was yesterday."
They gotta give you more control options are the ability to remap everything
the only time i managed to get a tank the beta ended half way through my first fight with it :(
"Disclosure, last Battlefield game I really got into was BF3.

Overall, I liked the gameplay as an infantryman.

Getting used to controller aim took a bit of time but by the end I was getting the hang of it, had to reduce sensitivity quite a bit. Distinguishing enemy from teammate could be made easier, uniform color, helmets etc etc. Don't know if there is an easier way to throw grenades, but pressing Dpad Up and then R2 is not fun. I hope the final game lets me customize loadouts for easy access, I really dislike having to Press L1 and having to choose attachments on every new match. Also, not being able to manually highlight an enemy is so bad, the game is apparently supposed to do it after you aim at them but most of the time they pass by unnoticed? I did play BF1 a couple of days after getting a PS5 and noticed that the Medic distance that showed after being down really helped a lot to not just respawn asap, a really would like to have it back unless it was in the beta and I just did not notice it?

Vehicles,

I'm ok with the ground Vehicles.

Flying though, it was a pain in the ass. I was a pretty good heli pilot on BF3 but here the default controls felt weird to me, it wasn't until I change some to Alternate that I could get a bit more comfortable. Are the controls that different from BF3 or did I just lose touch? Lock-in Missiles also felt useless against helis other than the transport one, but that might just be my team not helping out once flares were deployed.

Map/Game Mode

I'm not a fan of Conquest and specially not in as big of a scale as this. I'd much prefer Rush or a similar mode where there is a clear objective on a small to medium size map. Having Conquest on a big size map really took a lot of fun out of the beta for me.

With that said, if I still liked it on my least favorite game mode. Then I can't wait to try custom lobbies with smaller maps, less flying vehicles and Portal."
"You not liking Conquest makes sense given you were a BF3 player, before BF4, Rush was their main game mode. It wasn't until 4 that they really pushed focus on conquest harder than rush, like in 3 yeah, conquest was a thing and people enjoyed it, but Rush was definitely the main mode back then. I personally really like the big maps, it gives me a chance to have different engagements at basically any point."
"Anyone know if I can cancel my pre-order, considering I already downloaded and played the early-access beta (resulting from pre-ordering) ?"
Of course
"My thoughts that no one asked for: 

Pros: 

• Gunplay overall

• Graphics 

• Fun vehicle play 

• Dynamic weather and events are cool 

Negatives: 

• Specialist system (creates confusion and decreases teamwork) 

• Specialist balance (some of them are insanely weak and won’t be used after a few days of gameplay) 

• Performance issues (Flickering is really bad on console) 

• Armor Plates for free every life 

• Visibility 

• Lack of understanding as to what’s going on

• Bugs, bugs and also bugs 

Concerns for future: 

• Map size (There’s a map 3x bigger than Orbital?!!?) 

• Weapon customisation (seems very limited) 

• Dynamic events although cool might become an annoying gameplay disruption but that’s yet to be seen

Just some rough thoughts I had."
"I played one round and then deleted from my console. I did not encounter any bugs, the game just feels like it needs another year to bake before a beta is released."
"If I wanted to play call of duty, I’d buy call of duty. The gritty feel of Battlefield 4 will forever be missed. Guess halo and far cry will have to do until you guys fix this cartoonish feel"
"They brought specialists in because ""managmnet liked the innovative approach of call of duty""
They mimicked the shittiest bit of mw?!"
They probably liked how they could make money from skins for those characters.
"Literally that, Google it and youll see the article, ""impressed by innovation"" despite people. Hating it, fuck em I'm not buying that shit"
"I loved 2042 so far, you're just being sour."
Nah just being a battlefield fan. You realise the Internet is full of people with different opinions?
"I've tried to dislike it without being a debbie downer but it's kinda hard because my reaction to 2042 wasn't really anger, it was sadness. And some use anger as a coping mechanism for sadness."
"I started on a *really* negative experience with the early access beta. Servers were half full of AI which were beyond stupid, bad enough to actively make the games a worse experience, and I couldn't shake the feeling that Battlefield as we know it is dead - if ***this*** is what they marketed with Battlefield 3 & 4 material, then we're doomed.

Come open beta to everyone, and everything changed. The game was fun and the action pretty evenly spread out with 128 actual players, and I had time to mill over the fact that while I think the marketing team screwed the pooch with their target audience, the game is Battlefield 2042 - similarly to 2142, it's a spin-off and not a sequel, free to take as many liberties as it wants.

I do think the game would be better off without the Plus system and letting us pick our loadouts at spawn, the Specialists need to go back to drawing board and the maps definitely need work as they're barren and empty - destruction needs to play a bigger part too - but the general gameplay was fun and I can see myself rolling out with my squad in a new title for the first time since Battlefield 4. I don't see this game exactly yielding 1000+ hours, but I'm sure it's got fun to be had.

Ps. This isn't my first Battlefield rodeo. BF3 took 3 months to get a complete gunplay and physics overhaul, Battlefield 4 took 6 months. I'm not even remotely expecting this to be an exception and would advice everyone to think twice about buying into it early, and against anyone to pre-ordering it. It *will* be broken."
"I had similar experience and even noticed more people throwing med and ammo crates down on Sat vs Wednesday.   Now if it was visible in the hud where those were thrown down, that would be helpful."
Yes! Way more people throwing down crates to support themselves and others during the weekend.
well it is kind of a sequel for BF4 but i understand what you mean. I believe that in the future you can customize what you want in the plus system and at least i hope that means we could change our primary attachments in the spawn menu as well.
"I don’t care what anyone says, the beta was one of my most fun experiences I’ve had playing a FPS game. Sure it was buggy but it’s expected with a beta. I cannot wait until the full game releases and there’s so much more to do and mess with. No matter if I was playing the objective, capturing points and killing people, or messing around with vehicles, the tornado, and the rocket, I found myself having fun. And in my opinion having fun is the only real point in playing a game. I can see myself playing Battlefield 2042 for the foreseeable future."
Did you play with a squad(friends)? Or solo?
Solo. I don’t have friends to play with
Gotcha
"You really have no problems with clones everywhere and the teamwork being dead?

I enjoyed beta too but these things really damage the game"
"I like the idea of colorized uniforms.  I do think this obvious clone issue will somewhat dissappear with the skins and helmets in the full game.

Teamwork isn't gonna happen on a new game , new map and as people are just messing around. That will happen in time and is usually more dependent on you playing with friends as a squad anyways.

I do think there a ton of valid complaints but I also had a blast. The ui needs a lot of work and some gameplay design choices like revive time need to be addressed.  I think people are way over obsessing on the impact of some of the details that are missing or the impact of specialist kits. 95% of the time the specialist kits didn't have a huge bearing on how combat played out. The grappling hook is probably the most noticeable but even then it doesn't drastically change combat most of the time."
"The time part is what people forgot. As a hard-core BF1 player,  early days of BF1 were a grenade spamming mess with 0 coordination. As people grow used to routes and such, teamwork naturally begins to form. My only complaint is the weapons and gadgets not being tied to classes will eventually cause everyone to go for a jack of all trades number 1 meta build."
"You shouldn’t be looking at player models anyways. I have never once stopped to look at models before shooting in any game ever. No friendly icon = shoot.

Teamwork has been dead for a long time, people just have warped memories. You still want a mix of equipment in your squad, we were playing together and easily got top squad every game and had a ton of fun working together.

The biggest problem was the medic hot keys being fucked so nobody does it. Hopefully they touch it up by release and we can have the 1/2 superstar medics per team running around picking people up."
"Nah, don’t care about the clones, when I’m playing I’m not really caring what my teammates and enemies look like, and yeah you have a point with the teamwork, but I wouldn’t call it completely dead. I’ve had a couple games where my team (or the other team) was playing certain parts very well together. And as I stated above to another user I play solo because of a lack of friends, so I don’t really care what my team is doing. I play to have fun, winning is second priority."
"> Nah, don’t care about the clones, when I’m playing I’m not really caring what my teammates and enemies look like

Well, differentiating friend from foe is pretty integral to being alert and engaging in firefights, but okay.


As for the teamwork, it was hard enough to get the majority of 32 players to work together in previous games. Those small groups who do, will have a lessened effect on the match in this game, due to there being 64 players per team and the maps being even bigger. Whatever sense you had of a team ""playing certain parts very well together"", was likely just a zerg that happened to work out."
"A squad could have a lot more influence in prior games, as you said. Maybe if they’d increased squad size to 8 with the doubled player count, that would still be true. 4 players in a 128 player game won’t be able to effectively flank a zerg because even if a few people actually defend they’ll probably have greater numbers than the flanking squad. Incentive for squad play is killed when you can’t actually be useful playing as a squad."
"Not to mention, with 64 players on the opposite team, there's even more tanks/helicopters/apcs than before."
how long have you been playing battlefield for ?
"How dare someone not care about the things you fixate on?

Every person that pays the beta is not going to have a terrible experience. Some people here haven’t played the backlog of BF titles. Some people played it for what it was, a game. Some of those same people looking to get into BF are here for the first time. Likewise, some people didn’t bust out their ruby glasses to think back and whisper sweet nothings about BFV now that there is something new to grouphate or whatever.

Some people are just playing a game dude."
"I've only played BF1 and BF4 but everybody looking the same never really impacted me because thats what happens in these kind of games, there's generally just a few skins that everybody is assigned randomly and that's it. Teamwork felt the same as the other games if not better, given you can clearly see on the spawn map where your teammates are and where the general action is so you know where best to spawn for the most action. I don't see why people feel differently about these things lol"
"Characters looking the same is a common theme in Battlefield. Was V your first entry to the franchise?

&#x200B;

Teamwork? In a beta? Are you serious? Does anyone not remember the Battlefield 3 beta which was just Metro?"
I spent 19 hours playing it and really had a ton of fun with it. There are certainly things that need fixed but I definitely see me putting in a whole bunch of hours into this game. Can't wait.
"Right? Like I know the game isn’t perfect, but no games really are. I’m not going to knock anyone for hating it or disliking it, but I’m not going to agree with them either"
I'm in the same boat my friend. Thoroughly enjoyed it and expect a more polished product with release (or at least patches after the fact). I'm on Xbox and played solo as well. None of my friends play BF which is a shame.
"Yup and the new* meta being able to C5 x3 on the sniper drone is a whole new game in and of itself.  Instant kill on tanks and helicopters if you fly in their way, the 250M range is quite generous, especially from the top of B.  I had so much fun with the flying IED."
Lulz
"I had a lot of fun too. Played with 2 other friends and we would just pick a point we didnt have and take it over. Generally had 30+ kills every game. Every body on our team was able to revive each other too. 

Only big issues I had with the game was the obvious bugs and helicopters being impossible to kill. We seriously would all switch to lock on rocket and they guy just strafed right and the missiles missed lmao"
"Holy shit, what a small world. I'm almost certain I played at least 2 matches with you in my squad. I was pipaman247 (was playing on PS5)."
What was your first Battlefield and how much of recent games have you played?
"I really loved it, i had lots of fun flying the little bird heli and attacking the roofs.

The return to massive maps was good and also i think the more arcady vibe was like bf1942.

i look forward to this one, i cant wait to see it my yellow belly attack biplane will be on portal!"
[已移除]
its just awful
The game is trash
"Man I fucking love battlefield but I find myself agreeing with a lot of people on here. I won’t cancel my preorder because I have too much pride and I will eat a$$ for the Battlefield 4 sequel but yeah no, shit needs to get fixed fast. Some shit didn’t make sense and I know that it can be WAY WAY BETTER dude. I hope Dice can listen to all of these comments and pull through strong and make this title the best battlefield yet.

I also want to add that we need the OLD KNIFE TAKEDOWN back! I need to look into the eyes of my enemies in first person when I take his chain, not no Warframe/Cod 3rd person takedown. Let me look into their SOUL"
I know that pride thing all too well also but trust me you'll most likely be beta testing once it's released and I wouldn't be surprised if it's extremely the same game as the beta was. I have a feeling that pre version thing was a gimmick to try to salvage sales and get pre orders etc. Good luck though you won't be the only one beta testing
"Well, back to Hardline."
Is there an active hardcore population on hardline?
"Not Hardcore per say, but there's a lot of active servers on Xbox."
"I was heavily disappointed with this beta and it really killed so much hype it built up.

It felt like I was playing Call of Duty Warzone but with more colorful graphics.

There was ZERO teamwork involved and the game honestly focused more on being a mercenary rather than a team player

So many bugs and glitches. The amount of bugs, glitches, stuttering, frame rate issues in this beta really made this game unplayable for me and really unenjoyable for others. 

Why does everyone look the same?! Who at dice thought this would be a great idea?!!

There’s little to absolutely no class customization other than the plus system

Vehicle controls are ATROCIOUS. Flying was absolutely horrible with the controls. 

No spotting? What happened to the spotting function? Apparently it’s there but it doesn’t work… like really?! 

Gunplay felt like it was ripped straight out of modern warfare 2019 and sometimes it felt very inconsistent hitting your shots. Sniping was such a huge downgrade

Optimization for pc is absolutely horrible

TL:DR: This game felt like it was a cheap copy of BF4 made by some third party Chinese company"
"I had a lot of fun playing the beta. Enjoyed playing with my son, we can't wait to get cracking on it again at launch."
"Sort the bugs, hit reg and lag.

Improve the movement, less Usain Bolt.

Fix the class system.

Fix scoreboard and menus 

Improve the shooting.

There might be a decent game in there. We might need to wait 6 months past launch though."
I enjoyed it a lot. I like option to call vehicle and not having run all the time from action to action.
"Some thoughts:

Gunplay felt good, but I couldn’t help but notice that the AK specifically, felt worse with the grip than without. 

I don’t really dig the specialist system, I enjoy some of the concepts put forth for them, but overall having the same people for each team makes identifying enemies really difficult, especially when we’re talking about two different countries at war with eachother. 

The map itself was… okay? Being as huge as it was, it gets to the point where there’s only meaningful fights at B, and one or two other flags at a time, and anywhere else you basically go uncontested for like, ten minutes straight. 

The Osprey (condor?) sometimes felt a little too strong where some ground vehicles felt pathetically light. I domed dudes through the LAATV with the glock, and had an AA LAV killed by a team of snipers from B roof. There’s enough Anti-vehicle options that worrying about people with guns that can kill vehicles seems insane, especially when ammo boxes can be used by anyone. Just a bad balance for vehicles imo. 

The ranger drone was OK, but I spawned a few in and they did a whole lot of nothing. For a mobile AI with a PKM mounted to them, it feels like they have no actual use. 

The ability to change to a different caliber on the M5 and have it accelerate it’s ROF. 

I faced a couple really frustrating bugs too, like for a few matches being unable to equip any of the non-defaults. My AK not saving the attachments post-death. Really, really bad FPS on a 2070s at 1440p. 

Also, the almost Apex-like sliding just felt off. Sometimes you gigaslide down a hill, other times? You go like a foot on the same exact hill. 


Overall, it was an okay experience, but… the only game from this big release year for FPS that has seemed like it’s worth my time is Infinite. Which sucks. I played from BC1 to BF4 before BF1 and V ended up no fun, so I was hoping to get back in to one of my favorite franchises. Oh well, though."
"I bought my PS5 for this?  I actually refer to it and my PS4 as the ""battlefield machine"".

I totally get that it is a beta and things are left out.  I didn't care for the gameplay.  The specialist system is a downgrade from the previous game.  The close quarters combat felt worse than the previous game.  I think I am disappointed in things that I know will.nit be improved."
"To me it feel like they’re just trying to reskin 4 with some things added not it’s own specific feel like 1, bad co2 and 5 

My biggest dislike is that the body positioning that 5 had seems to have been removed, by this I mean you can dive to the left then look to the right and see your feet and then shuffle backwards (also didn’t check to see if crouch running was in 2042) 

The snipers require 3 body shots to kill which is terrible by the time you’ve hit the 2nd shot and ready for the 3rd the enemy is behind cover 

Air vehicles seem way too overpowered as I didn’t find / unlock any lock-on missiles (hopefully there will be some on release) 

The time to kill seems way too inconsistent as you can effectively instakill an enemy or you’ll still get 5 to 7 hit markers and their still running about 

I will still play the game but I think it’s going to be a difficult game to consistently play compared to other fps games this year"
"I really liked it was fun, the vehicles especially the transport helicopters felt great the only thing  that I don’t like to much is the specialist system i just don’t like not know what my enemy could have who knows he could be running a sniper with anti mat and rockets and my cover wouldn’t work I think an easy solution would be to do what bf4 did and lock a small amount of items to certain classes"
"I saw someone suggest having the specialist get one extra locked gadget like the woman medic...give her the Med Crate. Give the Ammo crate to someone. So at least you have 2 dedicated characters that have meds and ammo.   


Also flags need to have Ammo and Med stations like the past 2 games did. And up the dropped ammo count. I was getting a paltry 15 bullets from downed baddies. I swore the number was higher on early access day one. 

&#x200B;

Even the ammo crate only gives you 50 max!!"
"Why is reviving and swapping weapons both on E? Why is swapping them even an option while the player is laying there asking for help and ready to play again? 
So many times when i just couldn’t revive someone because all i could interact with was the weapon. It would also feel better if the reviving process would be locked in after 1 or 2 seconds so you can stop pressing the button."
"Yeah that's what I also don't get. So maaany BF Parts are out and all have the same base mechanics kinda and they fuck something like this up? xD   
Stuff like this was pretty perfect in BFV, I also don't get it :D 

Also stuff like Firemode.. The HUD is full of shit but you can't see in which mode your weapon is RN.. like really DICE? hahaha  
I guess those are just parts that came together from different development teams and they just pushed it out for the beta.   


Let's hope for the best for release! I'm still kinda hypie and I don't even know why. Something was still a lot of fun about this beta. Guess it's just the nostalgia after 2 titles that were playing in the past."
Same on PS (it's square). I gave up even attempting to revive anyone because I would be more likely to pick up a weapon I didn't want.
Playing support is the only thing i like about BF. I‘m not so much into shooters. The fact that most people didn’t wait to be revived because it was either buggy or they didn’t even see supports near them and just had to guess by the skin while also not knowing if it was an enemy Support just made me really sad.
"I wonder how many attachments the guns will have at full relase...will  the plus system have all attachments available to select from? In bf4, guns had like 30 attachments to choose from. Seems like it will be a mess."
"I hope not. You would need an ultra wide monitor setup just to see everything. I think what will happen is you select which attachments you want prior to the game, similar to the other games, and then change stuff out just like we saw in the beta."
battlefield: diversity hire edition. when they brought in some cod devs i knew the game was ruined. why do they have to infect every single game.
"It just felt…bad on consoles. The controls felt wonk, the maps felt empty, I didn’t feel like I was “in” a map like previous battlefields if that makes any sense. The gunplay wasn’t gratifying and the whole game just felt sterile. I tried a few matches and just couldn’t even muster the attention to finish a whole match"
"Guy that didn't even finish a round is expert on game.

Only in Battlefield."
"If it were a quality game, I would have finished a round"
"Ran like crap on series x, lots of visual glitches and bugs but was mostly ok on my 3080."
"Bad 

Specialists, super sliding, gun customisation
Rovot dogs turrets grappling hooks
Gunplay mechanics
Revive system
Specialists
Specialists
Order system
No crouch run
Cod style create a class
Game plays too fast movement feels cheap and arcade  

Good
Aparantly rain looks good when it hits the gun"
"One of the worst shooters I have ever played. Felt nothing like a battlefield game. I’ve been playing battlefield since 1942. My favorite battlefield titles are BF4, BF1, and BC2 in no particular order. Looks like I’ll be sticking to those for at least the next 4 years unless something dramatically changes about the core feel of the game."
"I really enjoyed it but changes I would like to see:

The dmr needs a buff.  Its too weak.

Starting ammo needs to be increased.

Enemy identification needs improving.

Ui needs changing as its too confusing.

Stinger needs to be made a specialist specific gadget.  Everyone being able to use them makes it hell for aircraft being locked on endlessly.

Frame rate (on ps4) drops through the floor when its raining/tornado is on the map making the game unplayable.

Need to be able to mod weapons before the match starts.

Heli controls need adjusting abit because the way they are now just makes them so damn slow.

And more."
I wonder if the tornado issue on PS4 is even fixable. I remember that the building crashing down in Shanghai basically froze all old gen (PS3/X360) system.
Thats true I hope it is if not that map is gonna be hell on last gen.
"You had such a good sandbox in V, and you took it all away. Thanks for nothing."
"Loved it, had a great time. Excited for the full release."
As someone that didn’t like the game I find it so disrespectful and disgusting that you got downvoted for liking the game. I’m apart of the “hate mob” because I don’t like it but you getting downvoted for it is despicable
"I agree, definitely a lot of bugs and things that are to be sorted out. But gameplay was fun and engaging. Hope the maps are designed in a way to encourage squad/team play. Overall loved the beta, wish it were still live"
"Stop making battlefield, PLEASE. My heart got broken into thousands of pieces.

And also here's an advice for people who thinks gunplay is fine, raise above or go back to call of duty."
"gO bAcK tO cAlL oF dUtY


Go eat an entire ass for even suggesting such a thing :-O"
Aww little bitch is mad. You need more of your momma's milk. Try her ass too.
"I thought the beta was really fun. Sliding was a great addition makes it feel much smoother movement wise. Very excited for the full game to come out. Just the upgrade BF needed in gameplay.

My favorite bfs were 3,4,1 in that order. I like how this progressed off of the 3 and 4 feel"
Y'all are really downvoting this guy for liking the demo. Are we not all allowed to have different tastes?
Battlefield subreddit is one of the dumbest places in the internet.come here for the drama .eat your daily dose of cringe and ago sleep
I loved every aspect of the game except the stupid specialists. It seriously has to go. I don't see why they felt the need to do that. Like in the middle of a intense firefight I see someone's grandma run pass me. Bring back the generic character models and switch it to class based
It was pretty fun. Definitely felt like a breath of fresh air. Hopefully the specialist system works out a little better in the launch build
Guess I'll be grinding my way to rank 500 on BFV before picking this up.
"Truly disappointing with the direction they're heading into.

Just for the LOVE OF FUCK, give us a Bad Company 3 in terms of gameplay"
Can't wait to play against all the salties that are through with BF on release day.
"Wait about a week when it’s 50% off, and you’ll might meet some of them :)"
Most fun I've had in a battlefield since 4. Can't wait for release.
"Is Dice really going to let this mess go out the door? WTF are these guys doing over there even releasing the beta in that state. My pc cost over $10k, there was no issue with my hardware and it's an insult letting BF 2042 inhabit space my hard drive. Its not even a graphical show case, Kena Bridge of Spirts is more impressive and that's a kids game. That 2 months old excuse just means the game is truly screwed because even if EA takes cattle prods to the Dice developers and holds their family members hostage there is not enough time left this year to complete the game. People are not wrong about it being a successor to BF4 because it's going to be an absolute embarrassment at launch and will most likey take a year for it to be fixed. If I don't see a delay I'll be seeing a refund. WTF Dice? I want this to succeed but there are so many issues that even if I tried to list them all I would always leave stuff out."
You sound like a spoiled little brat to me.
Spoilt brat? For $120 you better believe I feel entitled to a great product. Sit down
"It's already been stated that the beta build was nearly 7 months old. It doesn't represent the state of the game currently.

Yes there is a huge amount to be addressed, but this is not and never has been a final representation of the product. So, maybe you calm down a bit and play something else on your $10k rig."
"It's 2 months old and you clearly know nothing about game development and how pain staking the work is. You should show more respect to the developers, these people are so passionate and I guarantee these guys and gals are getting crunched right now and no matter how much pressure the top brass puts on the developers there is not enough time to work through it all. Makes for an incredibly depressing work environment and the suffering will make no difference."
Erm I'm not sure who you are aiming this at. But I'm not showing any disrespect to the devs
"Stop banging on. I'm aiming it at you with your child like attitude, you're coming across as the kind of person that thinks doxxing is a socially acceptable exercise. Blind fandom is toxic and the ""It'll be right"" additude doesn't help. If you cared you'd be brutality honest about the situation. That ""spoilt brat"" junk needs to stop too because I earnt my money and they need to earn theirs. We deserve better and the devs deserve to build what they have envisaged because this is their life's work. All the negative comments are justified and I don't care how much their PR team tries to distort reality, we aren't stupid."
Oh I see you're exercising your right to be a complete entitled ass. I didn't realise sorry. Carry on then.
"That's how trade works, money makes you entitled. We are all entitled to refunds too."
Then what's stopping you?
Depends if they listen to us or not. I will refund it if they continue to march this game off a cliff.
I think you may as well do it now. It won't be THAT different on release. Every BF game has been rough. Beta or no beta. Why don't you refund and put the money towards anger management classes then come back when the bugs are fixed?
You haven't seen anything close to rage during this exchange. If you think this is normal then you must be new here. Ive been playing since 1942 and this is shaping up to be their worst outting.
"Well same. This is a new direction for battlefield that's for sure. I'm quite excited for it. I remember BF3 being extremely controversial as people were expecting a BF2 reskin with modern tech.

It also felt incomplete and bug ridden. I'm not fussed if an old beta build doesn't run that well on my pc. Neither did the others"
"you're not a shareholder, nor are we.

we are entitled to refunds, but DICE are more entitled to shareholdes in todays world. I am on the same boat as you really, but just saying don't expect DICE or anyone involved with EA to give a rats ass about us"
Yeh this is why I won't buy their shares. Why invest in this business model? You think they would attract more investors by simply being better.
"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/EA/electronic-arts/stock-price-history

I'd invest in EA if I had the money."
"I wouldn't because I have always found trends not by thinking in terms of will it go up or down but is this a great product or business that I would love to own or participate in? Goodness is the only indicator that matters when I choose to invest and it works everytime. If EA became a great company I would invest. They just aren't. There are lies, dammed lies and then there are statistics. Don't let the numbers fool you, EA has been spiralling the drain for the past decade and they have no motivation to change."
If your PC cost over 10k then wew.
"The flaws are ridiculously bad.  Character models too small.  Factions are horrible.  Impossible to tell enemy’s from team mates.  Attempted Cod type movement that just feels broken.  The UI is garbage.

They have barely addressed any of the massive issues the community has with their game and I for one thought this beta was an embarrassing excuse for a game.

It’s unfortunate because my friends and I were so hyped for this game as we put so many hours into BF4 and BF2 but this game feels absolutely awful.

Canceled my pre order until they communicate their plans for the game because right now it’s in an embarrassing state."
I dont even think they can do much to fix the game when its fundamentally broken
"It's heartbreaking isn't it? It comes down to delaying it and missing the Christmas window, treating their player base with the respect they deserve and solidify the clout this series has in the video game industry OR rush out a broken mess in time for Christmas betting the farm on fans blind devotion and clueless well meaning parents will get them over the line. Guess which scenario I'm betting on?"
You paid $10k for your PC?  lol....a fool and his money are soon parted.
"I had the ability to build my dream rig so I did just that. VR, OLEDs and high end GPUs aren't cheap at the moment. Zero regrets. It was the best thing I did for myself during the pandemic."
"Lol, just ignore those envious bastards, everyone can spend his money how he wants to.   
Other are paying 50k for new cars that already lose 20% of it's worth while leaving the dealer lol. So fuk em."
"I would have only spent it on more damaging hedonistic endeavours anyway plus my health didn't go down the drain during lockdowns thanks to my black belt in a heavily modded beat saber. I occurred zero debt building it and it was essentially free anyway. Dream big if you're going to do anything, I had my mind set on the ultimate pc setup so it happened."
"Beta was super fun. I never had a problem identifying enemy from friend, but I can see how it has some problems.  I’m not gonna talk about issues like hitreg, CTDs, and general bugginess because it is a given in a beta.

•Revive
Probably my biggest issue with this game. The system in BFV was absolutely perfect. You went down and can look around for medics. It tells you how far the nearest medics are and if they’re coming for you. Then you get revived in a sort of fast animation and you’re back up. Why isn’t it like this in 2042??? I can see why people don’t want to revive because the animation takes too long, sucks, and there was no smokes (in the beta anyways). In my opinion they should’ve just stuck with syringe revives. The animation was way too slow in revives and leaves you wide open. At least when you’re reviving someone in BFV your movement animation would make it a bit difficult for enemies to shoot you while you’re reviving. And when you get revived in 2042 you’re stuck in this transition animation that takes forever to come out of. The whole thing is just so frustrating and a giant step back from the best system we had in BFV. The removal of the medic distance gui is making people give up faster too. How many times have I just given up when just before I die I see a medic running behind me. I know it’s probably going to be in the released version but I think it needs to be said.

•Specialists and class
The removal of the class system is actually not a big problem for me. But I see how specialists replacing it would be a problem. I dont think there should be a complete replacement of classes. I think we should have certain specialists under certain classes. Like the grapple dude in assault, medical grandma in medic, boris in support etc. And have the gadgets in appropriate classes as well. This way we van distinguish people and their roles. This leads into another issue I have.

•Communication
Idk if they said anything about communication, but where the fuck is the coms wheel? I hope its gonna be in the final build. If they said it will be i guess i missed it. Not being able to ask for ammo, or indicate youre coming to revive someone, or asking for health, is really annoying. Battlefield is supposed to be a team game so it kind of makes no sense for it not to be a feature in beta. The lack of a text box is annoying too. How many times I could’ve asked for a revive in chat? Too much.

•Weapons
I do love the new ingame attachment editing system but I really hope there will be way to change the attachments you have available through class system in the release build.  The variety is lacking and I hope this isn’t the end all be all of the attachments available. 

The beta was fun, but there is no way I think it will be ready for a November launch, even if this build is 2 months old. The game needs tons of polishing, because it’s super glitchy and incomplete as hell. I decided I’m not preordering still, but I will definitely buy at launch or when the game becomes more stable. I like the changes they tried, like specialists and more fluid movements, unlike most of this sub. People complaining about this game becoming COD are a bit delusional."
"I'm just too tired to write a summary of the shortcomings of the game and design decisions again, after I wrote so many reports at EA Answer HQ / forums for Battlefield V and the games before it for nothing.

After the debacle of Battlefront 2, Battlefield V, the TTK stuff after a brilliant pacific update (not gonna resurrect dead bodies like the launch of Battlefield 4, Battlefield 1 balance) ... I'm just to tired.

Dice has so much talent, technical ability and experience to produce the best shooters around - yet stupid design and management decisions kill the games they produce, sometimes way before the first installation of the game has happend.

It's just sad. The market is ready for a good competitor to COD / Warzone. Battlefield would be perfect, but Dice shoot itself in the foot again.

I don't want to complain about stupid parts of the game, the removal of class system and with it the identity of the game. One step forward, two steps back. Old features of previous titles are removed and the community begs for them to get implemented back. Again and Again, every release.

I don't have the power to hope for patches which will come ""soon"" for 2 years and get drip-feed small changes and bugfixes again.

I'm too old and done."
"I liked the core gameplay in the beta. Last time I was so hyped before BF4. But I really hope that it was a real old build and things are better in the current version. Also hope that there would some dividing between sides and not clone wars, it is really hard sometimes to understand if you are shooting an enemy or a friend. Gonna pre order in the end of the month"
"I ended up having a lot of fun, but there were some basic things missing that will hopefully be fixed for release. I love the scale of 128 players and the gunplay felt solid. Here's what I I think needs improvement:

- Single fire toggle on the ARs. Super important for these massive maps. Maybe it was in there but I couldn't find it. BF4 has a prompt on screen.

- The contact wheel on the Q button; I need to be able to request ammo and health seeing as most players are going with rockets now. 

- Picking up ammo and health passively off the backs of players who are carrying those gadgets like in Hardline

- Turning in the jets felt incredibly sluggish. I needed to scrape my mouse over and over like I was scrolling Instagram just to make one turn. Maybe that can be fixed in the settings but it shouldn't be like that by default.

- Crouch running, supressors on most guns, smoke grenades and other stealth options

- Everyone's already complaining about the specialists looking the same so I won't belabour it. Add default soldiers for the Russians and Americans and any other factions, and maybe a unique colour gradient for each side. 

- Honestly once Portal is out, I will probably only play servers with BF3 and BC2 factions. Class gameplay is sorely missed.  

- Up the XP rewards for healing/revival/ammo to encourage that behaviour and make the rewards more prominent on screen.

- Bipods for the LMGs. I think there is an accuracy bonus when you go prone but sometimes it doesn't activate properly. As is, I see no reason to use an LMG over an assault rifle. It should fit into a longer range category where you can take on multiple enemies outside of AR range, and be countered by snipers. 

- Stationery turrets, artillery, AA guns. This must be the first BF game in a while without these. 

All in all I had a good time and wish the beta went on longer. I don't understand all the negativity here - except for the bugs. Imo this seems like a massive step in the right direction after the debacle of BFV. I haven't even seen Dice call the playerbase uneducated yet!"
"Played it till the end, it was fun, it need more features.

I wish we would be able to save our attachment from plus system to the next match instead of it resetting.

Also, please add a loudout menu outside of match in the launch. In BF4, you have to be in a match to change loudout, however in 1/5 you can change loutout outside of match in the main menu.

Also while we're at it, if the bullet velocity of bolt action and dmr is like in 4 then they should make it like in 1/5, BF1/5 have fast bullet velocity, if it is infact like in 1/5 all along, then they should increase it just a little bit, since the map is big which the biggest being antartica, long range fight is common.

Another thing, I hope the call in system would also include artilery, rocket etc like it was in bf5 instead of just ranger/vehicles.

Or could instead, make the artilery/rocket call in to be exclusive to squad leader."
"Optimize the game and make teams more distinguishable pls?

Oh and I’ve been saying this a lot but I think adding a default milsim operator that has no special gadgets/abilities but can equip any 2 of the universal gadgets similar to the old recruit character in r6 siege is beneficial to the game because of A:it can pleases the players that wants to play as a no name soldier and B:it lets new players to understand the game first before playing the specialist characters"
I saw a video and someone had that idea. Make generic soldiers to choose from that have the traits of the classic classes.
Thats a great option actually cause then we can have people actually serving and fulfilling roles
"With the higher player count it might work better to not have every one be a specialist. But the problem would be how do you make it so the BF is not filled with specialist and people actually use non specialist. 

&#x200B;

At this point I think people would welcome it over what is apparent right now. We could all be wrong and DICE actually has factions etc but I do not see why they do and not say anything."
Just like the earth..... Flat.
I like it
"If the game releases like thi,s, DICE can kiss any hype they want to generate with the next game good bye"
Oof.
No single player campaign???? I just hope they don’t start making you pay for everything like cod ! Bring back premium. Once should be enough ! Games are pricey as it is
"What? Also premium has divided the playerbase, and made the game less fun for those unwilling to spend more on top of 60-70€$."
"So your willing to spend money every year for a pass than a onetime thing ? At least with premium you got maps every time they where released which worked out considerably cheaper than buying them individually. Skins were included in the game and didn’t have to be paid for, where as with most games nowadays skins have to be purchased it’s daylight robbery in my view."
"Skins were included in the game? Did you play bf1 or 5? They were either locked behind a paywall or loot boxes. Also skins matter a lot less than a gun or gadget which directly affects gameplay. Btw you're still getting post launch maps and guns etc except for free. Shocking, I know. I'd prefer no battle passes or any kind of microtransactions, but that ain't happening in this world."
I learned that this is one of the most toxic subreddits and communities ever and hell I thought r/politics was toxic
"""Toxic""...cristal kids.All critics are ""toxic""."
"Love this modern trend of dismissing all criticism, however valid or well argued, as ""toxic""."
"Way too much fun. Felt like I was playing BF3/4 again. Factions needs to come back tho, but you also gotta remember more than half the people playing the beta never played battlefield before so they don’t know they are supposed to help their team, but the game also doesn’t do a good enough job of telling you too"
"Hmmm, myself and a friend had an awesome time playing the game. It had issues (BF VET since 1942 they all have issues at launch), but nothing that couldn’t be fixed.

This community “hates” all new BFs at launch and then they end up becoming godly at some point. Personally, I think BF4 was a huge step back from BF3, but the beta for 2042 made me excited for the game."
"1942 vet here, as well, and feel exactly as you do.  First, it's always taken Dice a few ""patches"" to get right.  Second, in spite of all the problems, _I had fun_!  Probably more than in any other Battlefield game since the original."
"I enjoyed most of it. The TTK felt solid (minus some weapons), the atmosphere of the combined arms,  and the gorgeous (Xbox Series X) look of the map were solid.  I know weThe only thing that really bothered me were.

1.) Weapon imbalances. Some weapons were definitely over performing and some (LMG) need some kind of buff.

 2.) The sheer dominance of helicopters and the near uselessness of the stinger in trying to kill them. 

3.) Spawning into bullets and rockets. Just what it says.

4.) The jet feels like a bus being sluggish as hell.

5.) If someone can grapple to a roof there needs to be a secondary way (ladder) to get to them other than hoping you can peek and shoot them out before they see you.

6.) Please get rid of the armor. It is unneeded and makes for a really bad imbalance.

Anything related to options and controls I'm going to assume can be fixed at launch due to the options actually being enabled."
"I liked it, this was the first battlefield I had played and it seemed fun"
Do yourself a favor and buy a preowned bf4 for $10 and play it. Then be prepared to be let down when bf 2042 comes out.
Steam has BF4 too for really cheap.
I had a lot of fun
"Someone needs to compile dev tweets on here, everyone will see that things have been fixed and tweaked for the release."
\*allegedly fixed. if you're trusting theyre fixed just because devs says so after they just deployed a half assed open beta.... lol.
"I saw a post like that, maybe search on the 2042 sub"
"Overall I really liked the beta. Only thing I would complain about is the inconsistency of frames. 
For example I have a 2070 super with and i7 but only managed to average 80-100 FPS on low settings. Compared to the previous title I would get around 160-180 FPS."
"Look at you getting ass blasted into negative downvotes by all the shitty console plebs. Hahahahaha, yeah I'm sure the beta did suck on your overclocked toaster."
Playing Phantom Forces on Roblox was more fun than playing this.
☠️
This is the Roblox version of CoD
"I enjoyed it, but I am not blown away. Lots of polishing needs to be done."
"I loved it and am not regretting my purchase (16 hours in beta)

This is what needs to be changed/added IMO:

- Delete this ""scoreboard"" and bring back a normal one

- Hardcore

- A way to distinguish specialists based on team"
"Add nerfing the in-field customization to that list, and thats the absolute *bare minimum* that has to be changed for the game to be okay. Theres more that needs to be changed, but those changes are absolutely essential."
"After the not-fun BF1 and the disaster that was BFV, it's a refreshing change to go back to something more similar to what BF3 and BF4 were.  Really had a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to spending a lot of hours playing this over the winter.  I was on the fence about ordering, but I'm def. buying now no question."
"I had fun. Gunplay is super subjective, but I thought it was pretty good given the limited selection, and the TTK seemed fine. 

I don’t really mind the idea of the specialists. I do hope factions are distinguished from one another better at release though. It looks pretty dumb having a Mackay take down a Mackay and then get shot by another Mackay. Also they could probably tweak the availability of gadgets to bring back some of that “class” feeling, hopefully won’t be too difficult. 

The map got a bit old, but it’s just one of 12 at launch, so not worried about that. Weather effects, environmental destruction and the rocket/tornado set pieces were all very cool. I’m keen to see the other destructible environments though, I know they mentioned a fully destructible village in Hourglass. 

Pretty buggy, but all betas are. I’m excited for launch, I think it’ll be a lot of fun. Particularly excited for Portal, and interested to see Hazard Zone too."
"I had so much fun playing this beta, some things need changes but I can’t wait for the full release!"
"Convinced me to get the gold edition. Just don’t fuck it up on launch. Also before people say they don’t have time to fix the bugs and the performance, the bf1 beta was 2 times worse than this and bf1 had the smoothest launch in the last 10 years."
"It wasn't worse. It had text chat. This doesn't. It had pretty much complete settings menu, this has entire sections that are missing. It looked beautiful, this game specially interiors look horrible.

Also BF1 was revealed earlier in year, and launched on time in october without any delays. This game was announced in june and had delay and beta 1 month before launch."
This beta is worse than the BF3 Alpha.
"Got good bones. Plays very well, gunplay feels tight af. The biggest issue that 100% NEEDS to be addressed is the performance. There is no reason a 1080Ti, 2080 Super, and a 3090 (yes, tested on three different machines) should be getting huge frametime inconsistencies ranging between 58ms to 6.7ms. The average frame rate is good, but the frame stutter is ridiculous."
"Posted this in the 2042 subreddit but will post it here as well

I know many people shit on the game and I admit it has some issues, but some of you are just crazy to say it doesn't feel like a Battlefield game at all. I had a lot of BF moments during the beta and also a lot of fun.

I do think they need to work on making it more obvious who is friend and foe. They won't remove operators so everyone needs to stop suggesting that. The entire game is built around them, especially the map designs so just accept that they will exist and hope that they do something to help with the enemy/friendly visibility.

I think if we are going to have same looking specialist they are going to have to make the friendly/enemy indicator work 100% of the time. Right now it's about 95% of the time and that's just enough to make it a pain in the ass at times.

There are a lot of little issues that I do really hope they fix and I hope they address it with a post beta summary or something to that extent.

I also think a 3rd gadget slot of support items would really help. Everyone would have either the med pack, ammo crate or repair tool and i don't think that would affect gameplay in a bad way.

Either way, I had fun and so did all of my friends and we can't wait to play the game when it comes out."
">but some of you are just crazy to say it doesn't feel like a Battlefield game at all. 

They removed the core of the franchise which is classes and teamwork lol"
Guess we have different ideas on what makes a BF game. To me it's big maps and vehicles with big numbered firefights.
"You can have that in literally any large scale shooter.  
Planetside, Warzone, Arma... They all play entirely different though."
"I personally had a blast playing the beta, it was a bit buggy but that added to the fun."
"Oh my god you're all even more pathetic than I thought, listen to you all 😂😂😂


Anyway, my random thoughts as a BF player since BF2.

- Loved the game. 

- Operators appearance should ideally be able to be toggled off, but if not, there needs to be a hell of a lot more of them at launch.

- Appearance of specialists need to differ on each side, honestly I can't understand why you haven't done this. 

- Destruction of buildings is not enough. That's what keeps me playing, having variety to the map every time you play. Need BF4 level destruction at least. 

- TTK and gunplay is great, perfect imo. no need to change 

- AA missiles travel too slowly. Helis turning round and out running AA missiles across the map is fucking stupid, stop this. 

Melee attacks seem awkward."
Insane how many people in this thread say they hate the game when their favourite entries in the franchise are bf1/V lmaoo
?
What? Bf1 and V are perfectly fine. BF2042 is really a no for me (I have played all the franchise)
"if you prefer bf1 V to bf3/4 its no surprise you dont like this game. There was a significant chunk of bf players who didnt like the older setting in 1/V similar to how now there will be a significant chunk who dont like the modern setting in this game. Also shooting actually having recoil (at least on pc) compared to other games will put players off whether they want to admit thats the reason or not. 

the game isnt perfect and the most glaring issue is the class/operator system which makes it hard to tell enemy from teammate but people are acting like the game is objectively bad because of their personal preference to what kind of game they want to play"
"I never said I prefer older settings for not having recoil lol… my favorite battlefields are BF3 and 4. I actually went back to BF4 after the beta. 
What I didn’t like about the new battlefield is that it felt like a mashup of Warzone and Apex, I don’t like many of the futuristic features like grappling and all that shit, and also being able to modify the weapon while playing is non sense
This really is the battlefield for COD players"
"BF1 is widely regarded as one of the best games in the series and BFV, while it has its issues, has some of the best gunplay and movement of any battlefield game."
"I don't feel like DICE will have the time to update all the bad design changes within a month. We gave them so much feedback but there is not enough time simply. The game will be out in a month. Unless they were already aware of all these from other playtests, I don't see a lot of this being fixed. For now, I'll keep my preorder but the edge of my hype is gone."
Bro cancel the preorder and just do the EA play thing. Don’t support this bullshit ass game design. They lose out on their micro transactions I promise you they’ll reconsider this shit further down the line.
"The game was great, the only problem is the performances, only 80 fps at ultra settings with a 3080 it's too low"
Have you considered to not put everything on max? Turn down some useless settings or if you don't want to do that then wait for the DLSS and more optimizations.
They haven't implemented DLSS yet so chill out
"So you'd rather see them not improve performance by optimizing the game but force people to use upscaling to get more FPS? On only one GPU brand btw. Nice idea bruh.

3080 should get 80+ FPS at 4k maxed out with no DLSS."
"A lot of graphics features have not been implemented yet so we can't conclude that the beta is the same as the final product. 

Compare the amount of graphics customization available to what is in Battlefield 1 or Battlefield V - a lot of things are offered there that aren't offered in the 2042 Beta. There are still plenty of optimizations and features to be implemented that were not yet in the beta (remember they're also testing on consoles from 2013) and I don't think DICE would leave it such things out for the full release. 

Yes there is a good chance I can be wrong but there is no need to be hostile. I'm not sure which AAA games you're using to benchmark where you're getting 80+ FPS at 4k with max settings but I'm quite sure the 3090 is the ""high fps 4K gaming"" card."
The game is great? Lol
I was at 144fps at 1440p max settings with a 3070. Idk what went wrong with yours
"There are a lot of valid criticisms here, but some of ya'll sound like DICE killed your wife just because this isn't reskinned BF4, the game is buggy, or you refuse to learn new things. Get that Frito dust off your shoulders - you got too many chips there. If it takes hating the latest Battlefield release to enjoy the positives of the older games, then you only play yourself by being overly crotchety.

This was a beta. While I'm also extremely skeptical that the current DICE build is much further ahead than the beta we got, I at least feel positive knowing that I had a lot of fun with the beta in its current state. There's a lot of minor changes that would go a long way to improving the experience - that's reason to be positive. And if you can live with heroes/operators in other games, then you can live with them here, too. I'd rather the game be further along this close to release, too, but the game is not going to stay frozen in amber, and there's still a lot we haven't seen yet.

I reinstall 4, 1, and 5 at least a couple times a year because they all have different elements that I like. That is still going to be the case going forward. They all got elements I like and I don't like. But as it stands in 2042, the novelty of a large-scale battle with infantry, tanks, planes, etc. is still intact. What I'm most excited about is that the sandbox-style gameplay is back, and that's what matters most to me."
"Saying ""just learn new things"" is an oversimplification. If the mechanics of the game create a fundamentally different style of gameplay to previous titles, then it makes sense that people that love the previous titles might not love this one.

Many of the pillars of the series have been drastically changed or even removed in 2042. Plenty of people will like it (possibly more than ever as the changes are, imo, targetting a broader audience) but it is perfectly valid for people to be upset that the core audience of the series seems to have been disregarded."
"Those ""pillars of the series"" are more intact here than they were in 1 and 5. And the pillars present in Battlefield 4 are still here as well. Like I said, I enjoy the previous titles. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. But had I not given myself time to get used to how these games were different from prior entries in the series, then I would have missed out on a lot of fun. Gamers getting upset that it's not the exact game they had envisioned in their mind IS a bit ridiculous. Taking a binary view of ""good or bad"" when most of the bad is solvable and doesn't take away from the good IS ridiculous, too. Gamers shoot themselves in the foot by letting their first impressions stay set in stone and rule their emotions. Negative filtering is a cognitive distortion for a reason, and it doesn't do anybody any favors."
"The initial impression the beta left a lot of people is that team play is de-emphasised in multiple ways. That is the kind of thing I'm talking about as a pillar of the series, I'm not focused in on specific mechanics but rather the style and feel of the gameplay. And that certainly was _not_ absent from 1 and 5.

> Gamers getting upset that it's not the exact game they had envisioned in their mind IS a bit ridiculous

Maybe some people are doing this but there are plenty of much more reasonable takes on the game. I do think it is too early to definitely say how the gameplay will end up after release and some time to tune it, but I can certainly see why many people's first impressions are that the style and feel of the core gameplay has changed. 

> Taking a binary view of ""good or bad"" when most of the bad is solvable and doesn't take away from the good IS ridiculous, too.

My concern, and many others, is that what we consider the ""bad"" _isn't_ solvable. It isn't about bugs and polish, it is about fundamental design decisions that seem very unlikely to be changed."
"> This was a beta.

No it was a glorified demo but keep telling yourself that

> And if you can live with heroes/operators in other games, then you can live with them here, too. 

Why should we though? Is there a law that prohibits Battlefield from being different? 

> and there's still a lot we haven't seen yet

Ever take a second to wonder WHY Dice hasn’t shown more shit to the community yet?"
">Ever take a second to wonder WHY Dice hasn’t shown more shit to the community yet?

At this point, I can only guess they're holding stuff back to entice people back in, because they knew many long time fans would be extremely disappointed by whatever the hell that was on offer in the beta.

I'm starting to think this whole game and all the decisions such as ditching the iconic class system were designed around the new Hazard Zone. Maps as well, similar to how Bad Company 2 was all about Rush, and BF1 was tailored for Operations. Conquest was an after-thought in those games and that may very well be the case here.

Idk. I got nothing better at the moment, 2042 as a mainline BF entry makes no fucking sense to me on so many levels."
This is very well said I agree completely. While there were some bugs(that didn’t necessarily change gameplay at all) the game feels like a big improvement from a stale bfV.
"I swear, gamers are the most sensitive people around."
"I agree with all of this and will accept my downvotes from the overly enraged community right now. It's more commercial, but it's still fun. That's why most of us play video games. There are a tonne of more realistic options out there for those who need that type of immersion (WW3, Insurgency, Hell Let Loose, etc.)."
I'm just so happy that i got to play a modern battlefield game again..
"I really liked it, apart from all the bugs and a couple of missing features. I don’t see why there wasn’t a map you could pull out? It made it really hard to see where enemies were and where the objectives were. The snipers were also horrible in the game, bullet velocity was ass. Recoil was practically removed from the game it seems."
"Idk man I *really* wanted to like it, I just didn’t. Most of the bugs don’t bother me, but some of them are flat out embarrassing for this size company. 

And saying it’s a build from months ago is a cop out in my opinion. Why would releasing a months old build be okay anyway?

What *did* bother me was how the gameplay felt. Someone made a post about the scale of the beta and I think that summed it up perfectly. Every fight feels so far away and it doesn’t feel meaty to shoot someone. 


I think it’s important to recognize that some people are of course being negative pricks and just flaming every aspect of the beta because they didn’t like it, but most of us that didn’t enjoy it are heartbroken and want to help improve things"
"I find the game to be in an uplayable state.

Regardless of any of my opinions about the actual gameplay, the beta shows a desperately broken game."
"regardless how i think of the beta, i will not pay €60 for a base game"
This is the iteration which finally kills off the BF franchise. Won’t be another BF till next gen when they’ll relaunch it with a BF bad company iteration to get some nostalgia sales.
"I canned my pre order the experience was extreamly poor it felt like a very poor attempt at ground war 2.

Their is a fun game in their but EA need to eject the current decision makers who apprently only know how to make a cod title.

It's also 100% NOT READY for launch even with months of bug fixing the actual map design and core gameplay (see speclisit needs a completely redo)

Given EA want this to be their leading title they are currently looking to get out classed by halo and ignored by the call of duty community they need to face facts DICE fucked up again and the core gameplay needs another 6 months to be sorted preferably by the guys doing Portal.

EA are hands of with their studio so you can't even blame from the class system screw up. They would have perfectly happy with the stuff battlefield 5 was doing"
"The largest issue I have with the game is the atrocious audio. For whatever reason the game volume is 1/4 the volume it should be. You can barely hear gunshots 15m away from yourself. The mixing is just absolutely atrocious! It is absolutely unacceptable. 

The sheer volume of bugs is very disheartening. Literally every single system/mechanic is broken in some way. If you played the beta long enough you should have easily ran into or identified hundreds of bugs. But I'll ignore the bugs for this post. Its obviously broken in so many ways we didn't need a beta to find most of them. 

Game play wise the pacing is all wrong. With the introduction of more helicopters and the ability to spawn on certain air vehicles team wide has changed how the game is played. Its more of a deathmatch on points rather than a team offensive. 

The game is fun but its not very battlefield. I don't know how they fucked up the audio so bad but it is so abhorrently terrible."
Worst audio...from a AAA game. I thought for sure it was my settings or even my headphones...checked everything and it was fine. Im very shocked at how bad it is. Was hard to blame it on beta but man I hope it was just a beta bug because that lack of sound quality is enough on its own to turn me away.
"my biggest issue is with how annoying it was to use vehicles, why do tanks rotate so SLOW and then delay when you’re in third person? why do helicopters correct upwards when you pitch up or down? why do ospreys fly like freaking jets? why can you fly a helicopter upside down? so many questions. That and specialists, otherwise it was ok."
"did anyone else playing feel like they lacked utility as a player because of the operator system? I felt constantly like I had to pick between ammo or health or not crapping my pants when I saw a tank (rockets). I like a lot of the things that we saw, many of the ideas felt a little half baked, but its a beta so I'll allow for benefit of the doubt until we get launch copy impressions. 

The biggest problem I had was that none of the operators had abilities that felt like they promoted teamwork, it was all about the individual. The only thing that felt team promoted was the medic class, and quite frankly, the games existing state didnt allow me to be a team player with the medic's specific ability. I found it better for me to just heal myself. I couldn't easily see other health bars, the damn needle gun couldn't revive people (which should have been an ability if the game is left in its current state). also why couldn't the medic revive people faster? it just didn't make a whole lot of sense. 

the operator idea in BF is interesting to say the least in my opinion. I am excited to see how the game looks at launch based on the beta builds alleged age. But I think DICE has to work to allow players to weave team play in to the operators and the very selfish abilities that they have. I personally think that we should have 2 gadgets instead of one. obviously limitations, like no more than 1 type of resource box, multiple rocket launchers, etc. But being able to be a medic, have an ammo box, and a rocket? or having a repair tool and a rocket? now we're talking. I don't think that is something that seems to far-fetched, especially if we're going to take this new approach. 

I should clarify that I spent the majority of the beta using the medic class and being a support player. I enjoyed it quite a bit. but I felt very helpless a lot of the time because the current build was clearly built to support other things. I was sort of relegated some games to just flying the support chopper/osprey because, well its dope and really fun to be a floating gunship."
"I got Battlefield 2042 with my new computer, The beta was buggy as hell. It know its a beta but this close to launch? still this buggy?"
they did say the beta was a version from a few months ago
"Theyll say that to save face, We saw the same with 1 and V and probably before. And look how the game came out"
"I think they said that to try and deflect the shoddy reception, but even if it were true, it was still in an incredibly rough state for a game in development for years. 

There is zero way any company would release a beta that rough one month from launch....unless it was the best they had, and I think that is actually the case."
"If this is a company’s first exposure for their game, they should use a current version - especially with the reputation and financial damage arising with releasing half-baked games these days.

This beta alone has literally convinced me to not purchase the game."
"I've had an absolute blast playing the beta. Definitely needs a little bit more polish and a few adjustments but nothing too concerning. Specialists is not a bad idea, but they need to balance them correctly so that everybody isn't running around with just the grapple all the time. The core gameplay is fun. Hopefully, they can make the changes that need to be made before the launch."
"I had fun, that’s what matters."

>t. DICE employee trying to keep their job
"The games is shit, it is no longer a war simulation, now it’s just an arcade shooter trying to be a war simulator"
I'm not worried. I know you'll ship out a better product than that play demo. Looking forward.
It's way too late at this point to do anything substantial. They would have to delay it again but EA will not allow it.
"They did state that the build was months old, but for all i know that is a big lie. Not saying it is and remaining hopeful that it isn't and it is buttery smooth on release, but wont be too upset if it pulls a bf4 and has a buggy release, with some patches a few months later."
"It's the exact same build from the closed play-test a month ago. I know, because I played it then. Can't say for sure how long ago that build was forked off the main, but it's definitely old. People are working their asses off to get it ready."
"Exactly! Just like they did with BFV!


Wait..."
" Xbox one X player along with series X player complaints here. 
So first and foremost, mainly for myself, I hate to be the BFF Veteran stereotype, but they ruined aircraft. They buffed transports which I like. The helicopters have roughly the same firepower, but they destroyed the movement. In battlefield 4, you were able to use your momentum to your advantage, it was so much more fluid and realistic. Now it's a similar experience to the helicopter in warzone, which was absolutely garbage. Feels so on rails. They limited the possible movements that you can achieve. Which was a huge part to the heli feel in BF4. 
Jets are useless. They only exist to shoot down the enemy jet, they cant do anything else useful. It feels like an air-brake turns on everytime you turn. 
As for glitches: Incomplete audio (weapon sounds cut in and out and sound inconsistent, also weapon sounds were delayed after pulling the trigger) 
Immense server lag
Poorly done, slow laggy minimap
Poor and slow rendering (partially acceptable on my xbox one x bc it's old gen) 
The guns also felt very strange. Cant pin point what, but they just felt off. 
Time to kill is way too high unless you use the vector or shotgun.
I dont think the little bird should have rockets
Theres NO vehicle customization???? Or class customization??? I really hope that was a feature simply left out of the beta and not something they just didn't add. I'll be even more disappointed if I can't put ECM or more infantry oriented rockets on the attack helis. 
The gunner on the attack helis has a more limited range of motion (which is understandable as a nerf from BF4) 
The list goes on. I and many of the people I've talked to had high hopes it would have a BF4 feel, but that isnt the case. It felt more like Alex legends with the sliding and gunplay etc. Wasnt at all what I expected. 
However despite all of this, it is battlefield and I love every single one. I even loved and played the shit out of hardline and BFV.
That's all I can think of currently, I'm sure theres other issues I'm forgetting but this game needs alot more than just some ""polishing"". It needs reworks of entire features too. But, that's just my opinion. Downvote me, upvote me, I'm just stating my opinion in hope that it will go on to help fix the current state of 2042.


EDIT: This was the most fun I've had in quite awhile btw. Like I said I love battlefield no matter what."
"I enjoyed this Demo, looking forward to playing full game. I did not had too many problems, and game run smoothly. 

May  update video card to get better graphics, because I have old card but I don't find it necessary.  

I liked being able to fully customize soldier instead of being bound by class. 

And before anybody tells me I must be new to BF, I played the demo with Wake island too... guess which BF that was."
I guess reddit fanboys don't know how to have fun.
Bodied
"Insanely fun, the introduction of sliding and grappling hooks is great (and does not ""ruin the movement"") and the specialist/class package combo was also amazing, as was the ability to switch out attachments on the fly.  


The only complaints I have are it being a little hard to tell friend from foe, some general balance issues, and the guns feeling like lasers at times.   


Sidenote: You just know all these people going ""cancelled my preorder"" or ""not my battlefield"" are gonna be back in a couple months lmao."
You are kidding right? So you are saying you havent been killed from rooftops/trees anymore since the hook? You are lying if you didn't. It completely changes everything. Rooftops doesn't require ladder climbing or vehicles anymore. It's dumb as fuck
"Didn't have a problem with it, no, I just shot the guy on the roof or grappled up there myself lmao"
[已移除]
You do know there are more buildings on the map right? What a dumbass..
[已移除]
"Yeah, sounds like a skill issue."
"Didn’t pre order but after the beta, I won’t be buying it until it’s in a better state (a year or two) and when the ps5 is no longer scarce. I loved BFV but they screwed it over (lack of content for months and stopped making content plus the free skin then paid skin bs), they needed to regain my trust. I have no problem waiting or not playing as I have other things to do but I really wanted to like it."
Doubt they will be back because I really doubt this garbage will be fixed in couple of months lmao
See you in a couple months bud

Thanks for the gold!

"People just like being mad is what I get from this whole thread.

I wish they'd up squads back to 5 at most, and maybe pump up damage from some guns. Otherwise it ran decently enough considering its a Beta, visuals where fine for me (Personally don't like the mud splatters from BFV and 1, someone in another thread complained about that).

Yes the identifying friend or foe is a bit of a pain but its not the end of the world and once people start playing barbie dress up with cosmetics characters will start to look different so its not ""5 Macky's just ran by as much. At most they need to add more icons to each squad mate in the lower left to indicate what they packed for their equipment so you can make smarter choices about what to bring.

But this is battlefield and most pubbies will just grab whatever they want to play rather then care about comp because you've grown up absolutely watching a squad go full recon because everyone just wanted to snipe.

At least this time the sniper might actually have a gadget besides a radio spawn beacon."
">Yes the identifying friend or foe is a bit of a pain

This was a weekend Beta too, they could have left the settings like this to make sure it ran smoother, and of course any Battle Royal game in 2021 is going to have loads of character skins and customisation just wait and see. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and look forward to seeing the full thing in action, not just a single map and playstyle. The T system worked great. 

I was jumping over and back between this and Warzone so I could get a better comparison and maybe it was because of the beta being packed with players, but its was hella fun."
I had so much fun playing the beta. Cant wait for the full release to see what else the game has to offer.
"I am playing a lot of cod , apex , cs and more shorter so for me it's feeling kind of nice over all the bods are a bead idea and the swop Attachments are bead too but he imput time on PC feels good but not the fps heros ar not so good implementer but can be a good idea if don right 

I think the game needs 12 month more development and allot of help from the community but then it can be a noice game at all"
"I enjoyed it!  I think it has a lot of potential. But there's a lot of issues to fix like specialists, balance, vehicles controls (horrible), lack of classes..

Way too much negativity on this sub"
[刪除]
You missed nothing.
Count yourself lucky; the game sucks like a festering asshole of a diabetic horse on the period
wait I brought the game why can't I play it?
Hate to break it to you but the beta already ended on saturday. When did you pre order it? Because early access began on the 6th
"Preorder controversy, I want to go back to 2010 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat)"
"I actually had a great time. Would have wanted to try out another gamemode tho, like the breakthrough variant or something. But if I remember correctly, this is basically how DICE always does betas (conquest)."
"Aside from the obvious issues that will no doubt be addressed before the full release, I loved it. I mostly fly choppers and at first the controls felt clunky but once I got my settings right it was a blast.

Admittedly for some reason they decided to make aircraft more difficult to fly in this game. The little bird isn’t as agile as it was in BF4 but the attack helicopter is more agile than it was before. Not terrible, just takes some getting used to. Definitely need to turn off the stupid assisted flight."
"You can grapple hook headshot people, enough said."
I love it. Best Shooter I ever played with so much action and destruction going on. Just need to get a PS5 for 64 Vs 64 matches.
"I liked it. 

Vehicles are weird to drive. Weird bugs. 

But I liked it more than 4. Rush will be great when it launches. 

Also they gotta fix the bug where I had to disable a ccd just to get it to run properly on my 5950x"
"They aren't going to make any of these maps with Rush in mind.  Orbital certainly wasn't.

If rush has any chance it will be in BC2/BF3 portal maps.  It's going to be nonexistant in base 2042."
"Anyone up to make a r/lowsodiumBF2042 sub?

Edit: oh shit, it exists! lol"
And it's empty. Not surprised!
"I don't think anyone knows it exists. I certainly didn't.

Not sure why you seem to be taking it personal. I'm just looking for people to enjoy the game with since this community seems pretty hostile to anyone that had fun in the beta.

I mean, I simply posted a clip from the beta and it was downvoted."
"Alot of bugs regarding guns not remebering attachments, and game spawn you in with wrong specialist, but it was fun.

Biggest problem i experienced was that almost no one played recon and especially not support. Playing with grappling hook and sentry gun is way more fun.
The animation for support reviving is way too long in my opinion.
Also it sucked getting revived because of the time to stand up. It came to the point where me and my friends just held space as soon as we died.

And please add so we can change attachments before we spawn. It sucks when you have to spawn in a new environment with old attachments and change mid-battle"
"The gunplay was very fun. The grapling hook allowed me to do some sneaky pro gamer moves and get behind the enemies. Besides the character models I have another general complaint: Vehicles aka what seperates battlefield from the rest.

You can't hit anything with tanks that isn't already in your vision. I wish they made tank aiming like it was in bf4. In 2042 the turret lags a few second behind you which isn't fun.

Little bird is very fun. The attack heli is kind of useles. Either give it more rockets or increase the splash damage of the rockets. Jets should also have splash damage for air to ground attacks. Air vehicles are also very floaty. It feels slow to move trough air with them sometimes. I like how the roll on the helis is more controllable but please change the responsivnes back to the bf4 style of flying.

Why can't you orbit your vision around vertically when in a jeep? Please make it a full 360. When the camera comes close to the ground just move it forward towards the vehicle if that is why you locked it.

It is fine to experiment with new controls for a new game. But when it is objectivly worse you should change it back. The floaty controls don't help beginners at all."
"I went back and played BFV after the getting bored of the beta and holy shit everything from the gunplay destruction and animations feel so much better   I’m kinda mind blown just how much of a step back 2042 feels like

Also where’s my fucking crouch run :( 
And why does no one rez anymore ?"
No one revived cause of the painfull process of pulling the defibs out. Cant wait to see the polished game. Got up to almost rank 20.
I enjoyed the random strobe lighting lol
"Just felt like another half baked modern shooter to me honestly :/ A lot of frustration and a stark lack of quality of life things and gameplay mechanics I wasn't really a fan of personally. Felt pretty dreadful on my day one Xbone and had sooo many things that I just couldn't help but wonder ""Why?"" about lol   


Like why is the aim so bad and unsmooth on console? Why is there absolutely no difference between two countries soldiers at all? Why are people 3.5 feet tall? Seriously look at people in door ways or standing next to what is essentially a Tesla, they are laughably short for some reason. Which leads into another thing: People are like fucking ants beyond like 30 meters, it's laughable. Why is hit reg so bad? Just lots of ""Why's"""
"in the preordering options the Gold edition contains the ""Battlefield™ 2042 Year 1 Pass Cosmetic Pack"" which implies it's only cosmetic options, but in the description it says ""contains: 4 New Specialists (1 per Season of the Year 1 Pass)"", does this mean there will be playable specialists that can only be accessed with these passes? or will all actual game content be available with the base game?"
"What do you think?

Yes, there’ll be content you need to pay for. Though they might include some “free” option that 95% of players don’t have the patience or time to unlock.

*“See!? No content you HAVE to pay for! If you don’t feel like paying 10$ for the new meta specialist with the new meta weapon, you can just get 100 headshot kills with your handgun!”*"
"I’d imagine the cosmetics will not be obtainable after the season passes, but the specialists will be. Like how it’s currently done with apex legends if you’ve played that. Let’s be honest, apex was a massive success for respawn and EA wants the double dip money."
"To be honest it was fun but after like 2 hours it got very boring. Also it didn't felt like i was playing a battlefield game because there was no actual situation changing destruction classes or fractions, the helicopters felt weird and the bugs are really bad."
YT Gregor's video perfectly sums up my  thoughts on 2042
"Super fun beta apart from small things.

1. Please make operators class specific, the Medic class should not be able to take a M5 or C5 or a Ammobox and the same counts for the other classes. That's all we need to make this the same system as Battlefield 4.

2. We definitely need more Ammo for the guns at the beginning, I ran out of ammo after 2 kills and had no one to give me ammo. 

3. Helicopters need a nerf in range or fire power, the amount of times I got destroyed by a Helicopter that was 500+ meters away is absolutely ridiculous.

4. Change the looks of the teams, we need different factions so we don't all play the same characters."
I think ending the beta on a Sunday morning is a really out of touch move even if we knew about it in advance. What the hell kind of schedule was this?
disjointed
"The good:

1. Love the gunplay, it feels less random and more precise. Snipers are a bit meh though considering people are running much faster and maybe it could be helped with higher bullet speed. At first it felt really bad but then I realised I was often playing on servers with high ping.
2. TTK is about the right amount to be able to react to someone shooting you from a distance. Considering maps are big and there are open areas this helps a lot.
3. I like the movement (from my character perspective). One point though: IMO there's too little difference between the two sprint modes. Both give you about the same lag before shooting.
4. At first I didn't like the map for its size and openness but then I learned it better and it grew on me. There are distinct points where there's more or less fighting going on and I think this is by design. Despite everyone saying it's too big I rarely had any downtime playing beta. I clearly remember taking much more sectors completely alone in BFV and BF1. You can always parachute off a heli or a building or just redeploy on your squad if you're having problems of getting somewhere plus you can call a vehicle now. Even in spaces between points there's always some fighting.
5. I like it that tanks and helis are kinda OP. That's the point: a tank appearing in your sector SHOULD scare you and help the opposing team, not just die in first 20 seconds.
6. Attachments + menu is great.
7. In general I had a lot of fun despite the bugs and glitches, made a bunch of funny and cool clips and had a good laugh when playing with friends.

The bad:

1. Obvious issue of distinguishing friend or foe. I get people are going to look different once the cosmetics arrive but that doesn't help with my point. I should be able to tell that by a glance, not wait for UI to pop on.
2. No UI for when you're wounded to see if there are any medics or teammates around. This is really annoying considering it was a thing for years now. I believe this is the core of the issue with people not reviving anyone.
3. No scoreboard is just infinitely stupid. Not only people are already discouraged from playing a support or medic, now they don't even see the points they got from being useful to the team. Moreover it's a FPS: EVERYONE wants to see how they do compared to others, wtf are you achieving by hiding this? I really really hope it's different in the final game.
4. Better UI for people carrying ammo and medkits; Allow us to get ammo from the person himself; Give the man points for helping out; Callouts with clear UI indication of who needs ammo\\heals.
5. I hate that ammo is split between different types and not just taken from the same pool. I rarely use heavy ammo on my AK, why can't I just take more of the regular type? If common pool of ammo doesn't sound realistic to you I encourage you to find anything realistic about battlefield games lol
6. Movement animations of enemies seem too twitchy and harder to predict compared to previous two games."
"If the beta build is ""months old"" why was the beta delayed? Seems a bit weird."
"I’m basing this off of literally nothing but I think that’s a cop out. 

I think that they realized how shit the beta was but understood that they absolutely had to put it out when they did, so someone just said *”fuck it, just tell them it’s a really old build or something idk”*"
"I didn't see this mentioned yet, but I had a horrible issue whenever I was gunning in a ground vehicle. The turret would stutter side-to-side constantly. It made targeting infantry past 50m impossible, doubly so if you tried to zoom in, as that doubled the side-to-side movement."
"Tldr Overall I had fun it was a great time even with alot of issues, I don't preorder games so that was never a question for me and ill wait till the reviews come out to see if it's worth it.

Long version.

I'll get the negatives out first.

THE BUGS:
The AK attachments never saved so I ended up never using it because I had to reset the gun every life.
The elevator doors didn't open properly and glitched shut but you could walk through them.
The vehicles would somtimes float on the ground.
Parachutes inverting and looking weird when deployed.
The map didn't work so I couldn't view the whole map making it hard for me to track the ebb and flow of the battle.
The combi sight didn't work if I respawned with it equipped, I had to unequip it ADS then requip the combi sight to be able to change the zoom.

THINGS I DIDNT LIKE:
Melee felt slow and clunky.
The inability to change the zero on the sniper rifle made the weapon unusable for me and clearly many others because I saw far far fewer snipers then in other games.
Pistols seems really under powered compared to BF4 and BF1.
I would like the ability to change attachments in a menu and have that save and transfer between matches like the old battlefield games. I like the on the fly attachment changes but why can't we have both.
The movement doesn't flow quite right being unable to climb over walls just teller then you like BF1 added.

POSITIVES
I really enjoyed the gunplay and slides it took me till the second day to get into it but once I did it felt great.
The game looks amazing even on low which shocked me.
The different objectives making up one sector was really fun to keep the action high.
The tornado was really fun and fighting while flying around it with the parachute was great."
"Overall ran pretty damn smooth for me at max on a 2070s, which is a huge surprise being on a 34” 21:9 monitor. Only had some texture bugs a few times after super taxing moments with lots of explosions layered on top of entering/exiting vehicles quickly.  
  
Infantry play feels a bit CODified but that can be fixed with sprint-to-fire adjustments and tweaks to the slide/tac sprint cooldowns. I get that they’re gunning for the player base but it seems like no-nonsense-gunplay isn’t a selling point for the audience they’re trying to convert. Bunny hopping, jump shots, slide shots, etc. are what made cod a “sweat or get rekt” game that became less fun over time. It was fun for a weekend but idk how that would feel after 2+ years.  
  
The helicopters seem to be way too agile. The direction changes and throttle response during sharp turns is just insane. The way they move is extremely uncanny. I thought it was rubberbanding at first but after watching pilot POV gameplay the level of maneuverability was consistent and their physics just feels and looks broken to put it mildly.  
  
I was super stoked about this map but honestly think it’ll be an instant skip for me during the full release. Even before playing a dozen games you could see the flow and player behavior patterns. Players parachuting off the tower all game onto the hills and onto the D objectives was a pretty stale loop and the overall design of the map coupled with the cluster cap design led to a lack of an actual frontline of combat. In previous games you had a sense of unison with your teammates going after objectives even when nobody was using mics. Here it felt like I was just playing to run around and shoot stuff and blow shit up. Could just be personal preference but the cluster capping design felt like it split the team up way too much.  
  
I can’t say much that hasn’t been said as far as the specialist system goes. Being able to make a cod load out in battlefield just feels cheap and counter intuitive to what made the infantry combat so unique. Having a load out that covers every engagement feels very shallow."
"Man, this was easily the glitchiest game I have played in a long time. It was basically impossible to be a gunner on a tank."
"I think if the beta is reflective of the game at release then it will be divisive. What I personally want from a BF game is teamplay, the ability to work together, use spotting, supply ammo, heal and support my team as we capture and defend objectives. I just didn't get that feeling from the beta.

While you can do all those things in game, it doesn't seem designed around them. There's very little incentive to do so. Maybe it's the UI issue, but it doesn't feel good to capture or assist as there are no points awarded for it. Nevermind it being hard to see the points or navigate without a compass."
"To sum up my experience, I wasn't impressed.

I'll keep an eye out on it as we go forward. But It's definitely not a day 1 purchase."
Seems like specialist will be here to stay. They should turn each specialist into a sub class of the core 4 then introduce more in the future. Similar to OW but obviously don’t go overboard.
"Shit sucked, but it was fun."
Definitely needs to get delayed
Apart from the specialists I had a blast portal will definitely be a fun time
"My experience was more than meh, but less than wow.

I wasn’t able to join any friends because we were spread over different consoles and generations, so the teamwork aspect was sort of lost. But my largest gripe, upon reading more into it, was that as a PS5 player, I can’t play with any of my buddies that haven’t been able to upgrade yet. Which is why I ask, why can’t a PS5 player jump into the 64 player lobbies that will be available for PS4 players? I understand why (kind of, I question why all consoles can play in a 150 player game of Warzone) they can’t play in the 128 player lobbies, but I’d happily play in a smaller game in order to play with them."
"Can't help but think if they wanted specialist's so much why not handle them like Heroes in Battlefront, earn them in match and limit them. Defend so many flags in a match - gain access to defence specialist etc etc and then keep the class system as old as default. 

There's just so many smarter ways they could have handled them why they thought clone wars was the right choice is just so frustrating."
"Felt like the bastard child from a one night stand between Battlefield, Apex, and Warzone. I am not keen on the changes they’ve made to the core gameplay designs, namely the specialists and weapon loadout system being so open ended. Completely removed the strong sense of class identity I loved about battlefield, and pretty much ensures the eventual dominance of a single meta loadout, as we all saw during this. I may check up on this post launch, but as of right now I won’t be picking this up on day 1."
"My two cents; TLDR at the bottom.

Get rid of specialists, or somehow balance them. Everyone was just running around with grapple hook and RPGs.

This new system didn't promote reviving or support giving out ammo. Which is essential to the series.

Everyone looks exactly the same.

It did feel like ""Battlefield"", from the sound to those one of a kind moments, so that's good.

I really like the new on the fly + system for guns, really enhances how you come across a scenario.

UI/HUD needs some rework. Too much neon green/blue running across my screen. For example, the ""the sector has been taken"" banner that goes across of the top of the screen. Just obnoxious.

They need a cool down on sliding and hopping. I saw too much COD mechanics being used to avoid gunfire. Constant slide/crouch/jump without ADS kills. That's insanely casual and not fluid with how this series is. If they don't fix this, I likely won't be getting the game at all.

Fix all the bugs, there's frankly too many to even list. But the main ones being the shaking of sights when in a vehicle gunner, the random floating of people in vehicles when looking at them a certain way, people flying in the air when exiting a vehicle or hitting an odd glitch in the map, etc.


All in all this ""beta"" was really just a play session as DICE said it was a couple month old build. I will not be preordering or buying day one due to a lot of what I mentioned above. I believe the specialist introduction really hurt the core gameplay of this series. The grapple hook/RPG encourages single person vs team/squad combat, an essential part of gameplay mechanics for this series."
"The game didn't even run at a playable framerate on my rx570. They borked the system requirements. I wish I had been able to experience the gameplay, but thats hard to do at 15fps"
"It was fun, not quite the bf-feel tho.
Hated the armor system"
"My biggest issue is the gunplay with those guns. If that's indicative of how they see BF2042 playing, as in a really low reward, easy system, then this game is not for me. If the m5 is just a mistake then I'm still out until there is some meaningful testing showing there is some skill element reward"
"So far it's buggy, feels a bit off and player FPS has been lowered... stop focusing on improving the visuals when framers per second (and gameplay) is more important

shooters have turned themselves into FIFA, (nothing but graphical changes and removing content) sometimes changing the year"
"IF Portals is how they advertised it, I’m in for buying.
But I’m too worried about this, the gameplay design is bad, no more teamwork, no more factions, only elites skin with all out class. Air vehicles design is shit, US aircraft are the only with double flight mode, good luck balancing that. And I won’t even talk about visibility, if the devs really thought that searching for a blue dot on a guy to understand if it’s a friend or an enemy was a nice design choice…
I played the beta on a PS4 and was absolutely garbage, how can you encourage people in buying your game with so much problems in it?"
"I think I'm skipping this one. I was really looking forward to having two new games to play, but I think I'll just stick to Halo Infinite until this game has some major sale"
When the Servers were good I enjoy the game. The specilists are stupid. Too many Bugs and glitches. Squads are too small. We have now 128 players on the Server and we have only 4 man Squads?! I would like to See at least 6 in one squad.
"Overall, disappointed. Fun moments at times but it seems like a massive downgrade in key areas that have been improved over the years."
"One thing I absolutely don't understand why it is in the game is this ""traversal sprint"". It could be removed and it wouldn't gameplay in any significant way.

It feels like they glanced over to Modern Warfare and copy pasted the mechanic without much thought put into it. I tried out both auto traversal sprint and then regular sprint in gameplay and I haven't noticed any difference apart from the former being faster, so there is literally no reason to use the regular sprint ever. 

Apart from this, there are so many little things that eventually worsened the experience for me considerably. 

Why do I have to redo my attachments again every match?

Why is there almost no information in the selection screen for your loadouts?

Why do we only get very generic information about attachments? 

Why does traversal sprint exist? 

Why do half my ammo boxes disappear the moment I place them?

Why is performance alright and out of nowhere shits the bed for like 5 seconds?

Why is netcode so shit?

Why can't I see my own pings?

Why is there no info about incoming medics when you're down?

What's the point of having ""ENEMY GAINED/LOST SECTOR MAJORITY"" or big fucking pop ups on the left of the screen, when this info could be easily displayed with little icon at the top of the screen and a short audio cue like in previous titles?

Why does every single ammo type have to have its own ammo count, when it makes everything complicated?

On that note, why is the ammo box so underpowered and in turn the medic bag so overpowered?

Why is reviving a team mate such a PITA? More often than not my dude picks up their weapons several times before starting to revive, since for some reason picking up kits has priority over reviving...

Why are parts of the UI unnessecarily big, while stuff like your HP is a literal 2 pixel thick bar and barely visible or team mate icons in comparison?

Why is the scoreboard such doodoo?

Why do I get kicked out of the game without notice?

What's the deal with the ATROCIOUS menu navigation? Space to invite? I can't use my mouse to do that? Several options are present multiple times in several sub menues for no reason. Settings hard to read.

Why do you release a build that is several months old with so many bugs and issues and the next day you tell us the latest build has so many improvements yet we have to deal with so many issues?

Why can't I access the map in any way apart from the selection menu?

&#x200B;

I just don't get it..."
"Played the beta for 21 hours, I had a decent amount of fun with it but the issues (both technical and gameplay) are too glaring. Cancelled my pre-order and will probably wait to pick it up on sale at a later date."
"Had a lot of fun and the things I love:

o Game was beautiful minus the visual bugs that will likely be fixed (hopefully seeing enemies from friendlies is easier with what they have said they were doing)

o I liked the rocket and tornados, shit was crazy

o I may be the minority here but I like the movement, but I also like cod so maybe I’m the asshole here

Things I hope get changed that I didn’t like:

o Specialist aren’t going to work for bf players, they should have different skins for the same specialist if they are going to do that, based on the team you are on (think battlefront)

o If they keep the loud outs how they are currently, they need to move gadgets. No one is going to tote ammo or Heath anymore.

I am one of the “toxic crybabies” that canceled my preorder though. I hope when the game launches I end up buying it. Cheers, hope you all had fun.

Edit: format"
"Needs a delay . It’s battlefield so we all know it has a potential to be fun but with these glaring bugs , bad performance, missing features and messed up UI it’s not even ready to play from an accessibility level . The design of the maps and all the empty space and other design choices are also questionable"
"HUD Scale needs to be a thing like Horizon Zero Dawn has.

I don't want to play with no HUD, but would love to shrink the HUD. Even on my 27"" monitor, the HUD felt like it took up too much space"
They couldn't let it run through the end of Sunday? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)
"I feel the game is just trying to adopt a lot of COD things, especially the double tap sprinting and sliding. I’m not used to moving that fast in battlefield. It’s definitely smooth and fun on the PS5, but it just doesn’t feel like battlefield. I’m confident they’ll fix lots of these problems, I do really like the customizable weapon attachments in game"
"I really don’t think Conquest is where 2042 will shine, I firmly believe Operations is gonna be where the specialists really show value. Right now in Conquest, half the abilities are gimmicks. But in Operations where all 128 players are consolidating in 1-3 sectors, engineers setting up defenses will be important, limited flanking will make the grappling hook viable to vertically flank, Casper’s drone will be a counter to the flankers. Delta’s riot shield will help push in, plus whatever we haven’t seen. There’s a lot of cool shit they can do with the class evolution to specialists. I just wish they’d have some US and Russian only skins."
"Apart for the specialist and enemy visibility drama, the UI is the main issue right now, it's a huge stepback from the previous because lacks clarity as too much useless informaton is displayed and the important stuff is absent or fades in the background. The map sould be cleaner, we should be able to see squad in a easy manner and the scoreboard is total mess."
"Overall I had a highly positive experience. There were bugs yes, and problems too. But through it all I still had fun. It gives me BF3 Beta vibes. Gunplay was great, I personally enjoyed the movement, and it looks beautiful. Like I said before, there are definitely issues though. Not being able to tell friend from foe is a huge detriment. Menu bugs a plenty, a major one prevented me from using a wireless headset, but I've read that that issue is resolved in more recent versions of the game. Also changing controls is a nightmare without a preview layout, nobody knows what ""alternative"" is, especially when in previous installments it's been ""legacy"" or ""veteran"". The scoreboard is atrocious, DICE guys we just want to see our objective points/kills/assists/deaths and compared to everybody else in the lobby. Tornadoes were a huge highlight but felt like forever before it happened. I experienced a massive bug driving a Jeep while on stream, but it was more funny than anything else. The matchmaking needs a huge tune up. Loading into games also resets almost all customization which is frustrating at the very least. Finally, imo transferring between grappling hook to parachuting needs to be smoother. There's more but that's all I can think of. Again though, I had a highly positive experience. I felt like a 12 year old again when the tornado came into the map. It was pure mayhem and chaos but also beautiful. I *absolutely love* the grappling hook. The bones for the game are great. I can't wait for the full game in a month. The small amount of weapons and just a single map left me urning for more. I can't wait to see what else DICE has for us. I just hope the bugs players experienced during this beta aren't present in the final build and the last few issues are ironed out."
Did anyone get the bug when you would select a specialist and a list of all the portraits of operators from BF3 AND BC2 would show up as well?
"I'm not going to bother putting a detailed reasoning because that's probably putting more thought power in than DICE did.

1) Specialists need to either be reworked from scratch or axed flat out. Re-introduce the class system and take it from there. They also need to be redesigned for each faction with immediate recognition in mind. This is my biggest complaint by far.

2) There needs to be a big map view available in game.

3) Light blue is arguably the worst colour you can use for a HUD. Literally anything else would be better. I couldn't read what objectives where what, either a blue or orange square. 

 4) If you want crossplay between console and PC, console needs aim assist, a strong one at that. From my friend's experience, aim assist did not exist at all. PC is basically easy-mode in comparison.

5) There needs to be a server browser - not sure of this was a beta thing, but I wouldn't put it past DICE.

I've cancelled my pre-order not because of bugs, but simply that every basic game design rule in the book was broken and I have zero faith DICE will change anything on launch. If DICE can somehow fix the above and sort themselves out, I'll maybe buy it on the inevitable we didn't meet sales targets discount in the upcoming months of release."
"Definitely feel like they need to change the specialist/class system for better teamwork, maybe add another item slot to lock a class specific item into? Also they have to change the character models for each team because figuringout who'san enemy vs who's a teammat is annoyin.  Otherwise it could be a good game."
"Sad that it’s over.



We’ll meet again battlefield. Don’t know when, but we’ll meet again."
I do not vibe with the Specialists.
"I'm still gonna keep my pre order. but yikes, had one day with no lag,  and it was a blast to play.

the days that weren't were the rest of my time playing just simple things my parachute wouldn't open after I jump leading me to die.

the only constant thing was my screen would  aim at the sky. so as I was shooting, my field of view would move up and I'd die.

overall, a 6/10"
I warmed up to the game after 3 days but lack of teamplay due to specialist instead of classes baffles me. This part of the game definitely needs a rework. Other than that I’m quite okay about release. I don’t mention bugs because I expect them to be gone in a final release but overall it’s 7/10 feeling from beta which is “cautiously optimistic” because beta left me want for more. I just hope bugs and atrocious specialist system to be fixed in release version.
"I just requested the refund. 
This is not my Battlefield because I love to play in squad with medics, engineer or sniper and all soldiers looking the same hell no.
This is the new frostbite engine? What a disappointing."
"**Pros**: 

1. The Graphics - holy crap, what can you even say? 
2. The feel of the game - it felt very immersive 
3. The sound was very well done. Wearing headphones made it feel real
4. Being able to see players - the opposite of Cold War 
5. Teamwork - coming from COD, I love this.

&#x200B;

**Cons**:

1. Aimbots - Yes, they were there.  No kill cam masked the fact that a lot of cheaters were playing. 
2. Players looking like each other on each side 
3. Recoil seems a bit overdone on some weapons making them useless
4. Snipers are pretty useless.  I got sniped 0 times in the entire beta.  I was able to snipe people once in a while when I tried, but maybe it was the gun? Bullet velocity?
5. Hit detection really needs work or hitboxes need to be expanded a bit.

All in all loved the game.  Hope they work out some of the bugs before launch."
"Crikey I don’t understand how you can reference teamwork as a positive. From what I saw there was almost none, compared to previous Battlefield games."
Did you not play with friends? We each took a specific role on our own and complemented each other.
Honestly I felt overall disappointed. Kind of sucks that shooting the side of a concrete house with my tank does absolutely nothing. We had better destruction in battlefield 3 in battlefield 4. Why are we going backwards in this aspect? This overall felt like a dumbed down casual version of battlefield. We're getting closer and closer to cod.
"If they can sort out the bugs, hit detection, limit items to certain specialists and make the opposition more obvious I will be happy."
Specialists need to go. They are going to ruin the entire game.
"I’ll be up front and say that I haven’t played a Battlefield since 3 on the Xbox 360. I loved that game, it was so tight. Gunplay was great, sound design had punch, teamwork was fun, environments were destructible. 

I got none of that in this beta. Everyone was a one-man army (I don’t even need to talk about medics and revives). Gunplay felt, I dunno…floaty? The sound design wasn’t all that great to me, guns sounded like airsoft. 

On-the-fly customization is cool in concept but I feel that it destroys the fun of customizing your loadout and hitting the ground running. In the past you just worked with what you had at the time and you improvised. Now? Just change it on the fly! I feel this should be fixed by letting you change at ammo stations or ammo packs. 

How does aircraft work in this game? Did they remove grounded choppers and helis and replace them with a battlefront-like system?? I could not figure out how to get a Heli."
"Personally, i really enjoyed it! still got some issues with it, such as:

\-handful of bugs, such as being unable to bring up the airdrop UI.

\-Specialists were fine, except for the fact that they all look the same, so it feels like you're just fighting an army made of clones. add some sort of variety between soldiers so i don't end up in a firefight against myself.

\-I felt that i never had enough ammo to do anything, and I found myself equipping much smaller clips to my guns in order to keep from totally exhausting my ammo.

\-Should be able to edit guns outside of the battle, while I am fine with being able to change your attachments to suit different situations, i should be able to do that out of battle too.

However, there were things I did like:

\-I felt jets and other aircraft were much better, and i was able to control them more.

\-The airdrop system was overall a good idea, as I liked being able to call vehicles without having to die first.

\-I was kind of glad they found a way of keeping people from camping the elevators.

\-The tornadoes were really fun, and a good way of keeping a map from getting too boring or repetitive, however I wish there was more of a chance of this happening, as it only occurred once as I was playing.

Overall, I had a great time playing, and I am definitely gonna get it when it releases."
Sort out the specialists to encourage coordinated team play and please include smoke grenades to encourage the reviving of downed team mates/rushing objectives.
Are these the only attachments we will get per gun now?
"Definitely not a Battlefield veteran. But I picked up BF1 this past year for 5 bucks and have been playing the shit out of it, absolutely love it, and I gotta say, after playing the beta for a few hours I'm just underwhelmed.

I think I was largely hoping for a modern-style Battlefield 1, but feel like a lot of things that made Battlefield unique (to me) were just nixxed. I think a lot of this stuff can be compiled into 2 categories, things that can be reasonably changed, and things that will not be changed due to the foundation DICE/EA has layed.

Things I hope will change/have been confirmed:

-**commo rose/orders/quick chat**: I believe this has been confirmed elsewhere as being available in the final release; I've always thought this encourages team play and would be an extreme shame to have it missing.

-**UI overhaul**: Menus/options especially, seems pretty cluttered, sluggish, and difficult to navigate. A HUD cleanup of some sort would be pretty nice - I loved the simplicity/minimalistic aspect of BF1, and would appreciate a blend between that and an obviously more modern HUD here. I don't necessarily want or expect something as minimal as a WWI shooter obviously, the current HUD just feels messy, overbearing, and has useless information where actual useful information could be presented.

-**Friendly/Enemy distinction**: this is a huge criticism, as seen elsewhere, but I honestly expect there to be an easily implemented solution somewhere. FREE SKINNED UNIFORMS come to mind. The base game absolutely needs to come with some way to distinguish factions, and ideally without a dot over their head.

-**Gadget clean up**: Just across the board. You would think it would be pretty easy to limit Ammo crates to support, medic supplies to.... medics, etc. I personally don't mind the universal guns across all classes, but encouraging people to function as a self sustaining soldier is a big no-no in a ""team-based"" FPS, especially one with a history like Battlefield.

-**Performance/optimization**: hopefully beta was just an old build, but at times graphics look rough, with significant frame drops. Playing on RTX 2070, Ryzen 2700 for reference. Upgrading CPU in near future.

Things I don't expect to change:

-**Specialists**: obviously will not be removed from the final game, EA like moneys, buy skins, hero shooter, yada yada. Just doesn't feel as immersive to me as being thrown into battle as a ""generic"" soldier. Plenty of other posts going into detail here

-**Old Class System**: said elsewhere, why would someone choose medic, when they can just self sustain anyways? Why repair? No incentive to help your team anywhere, and the old class system was a way to combat this. I think encouraged team-play is still salvageable, DICE will just have to get creative. Not expecting any major changes regarding this upon release.

-**Universal Weapons**: again, not a huge issue personally, as long as DICE finds some way to encourage diversity among the chosen classes. I don't think we'll get limitations upon release or in future updates.

-**Movement**: coming from BF1, something about this movement feels.... ""Light?"" My first thought a few minutes into the Beta, was ""Wow, this feels like Warzone"". Extremely fast sprinting, feels kinda cheap, and I expect this is to negate the massive map and sparse objectives. Again, this is another area where team-play could be encouraged via vehicle transport or something similar.


Overall, slightly net negative in my book. Holding out for Portal, as I think the things DICE can't/won't change will inevitably be fixed by community ran servers. Lots of potential there, and I'm extremely excited for it. Looking like DICE is giving us a Battlefield sandbox, with lackluster core game modes. This is something I can get behind, but not something I'll pay $60 for and pre-order. See you guys for Christmas deals!"
"BF1 rocks and is one of my fave games.

There is no way I’m picking up this buggy mess, but I’ll see you on the fields of Flanders!"
"Im excited for the main game. Preordered and ready for day 1. I didn’t really have a negative experience in beta like some people on here. I dislike the specialist system but only for aesthetic reasons and because I prefer class system. I didn’t have a hard time distinguishing enemies from teammates either, its weird to me that other people did. 

There were a lot of bugs, such as the screen flashing and the “plus” system being wonky all the time. This has been my experience with BF betas though so its not that big of a deal.

I see people complaining about teamwork but i had no issue supporting my squad. I played mostly Casper and using my sensor grenades and drone(when it decides to work) to give vision to my team helped take over points.

I like the new fast paced gameplay. It definitely fits to modern era of shooters now. I noticed a decline in slower shooters these days, which is sad because I prefer them but I like speed as well.

I do have to ask though, why the 2 versions of sprint? Is the tactical sprint infinite or does it have cool down? I didnt use it often so I couldn’t tell."
"I actually had quite a bit of fun, and it felt like battlefield to me.
 My biggest complaint is the poor optimization on PC. With an i7-9700K, rtx 2070 and 16gb ram I was getting about 60fps at 1440p and around 80fps at 1080p on medium settings. I know I don't have the most mind blowing hardware, but it's not that old/dated. I have a PS5 so I'll probably play on that with EA play for a month while I was wait for Halo infinite."
"Idk how to feel, it needs a lot of work but I did have fun. Glad I did not pre order yet.."
"I wasnt able to even get in.. got pass the menu screen once, then said controller disconnected and wouldn't let me go further. Big sad."
Did anyone else have major fps problems? My game would run from 40-50 fps no matter what graphics settings I chose. I have a 1070 i7 16gbs ram and can run every game I own on high with good framerates. Was this just a glitch with the beta?
"Seeing a lot of negative and griping comments, I had a ton of fun! Can't wait to play when it comes out. It's a thumbs up for me ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)"
"I had fun but the had the same gripes as that everyone else is having. I canceled my preorder BUT will probably pick it up in the future when it goes on sales in a couple of months and they have had some time to fix some performance issues but not holding my breath on core features changing that I disliked. In the meantime, I’m going to download BFV and finally try it."
"I was extremely disappointed with 2042.  Starting simple with there being no spotting (or it potentially being there but not working) meant that the smaller player models and my colorblindness wreaked havoc on me.  I barely could see the other players, much less actually tell who was on what team.  

The TTK felt completely off as well.  On one hand it felt like I would die instantly, while shooting at a target felt like it would take everything I had to take them down.

The specialist idea would be fine in concept if there was some semblance of variety to how they looked.  Even just a randomized face would have made it better than running around in the uncanny valley for hours on end.

Sound design was terrible.  Some weapons were fine, others felt like an after thought, and the fact that the specialists all sounded like they were out there having a good old time made the rounds feel more like a giant paintball match than some war conflict.  The end result was that I kept getting images of Fortnite and Warzone in my head while I was playing.

I never really got my hands on any vehicles other than the truck and the jeep.  They felt ok, but not great.  The turrets were a bit of a pain to hit targets with, and in one of the vehicles (the AA?) the turret visual would just bounce and jerk the entire time making it unusable.  

Little things like the grenade toss animation I expect to be cleaned up by launch.  I did chuckle when I would throw one while prone and the hands would remain in the position of holding the weapon.

Speaking of weapons, the DMR feels completely useless and if you do use it you need to switch your gear to an ammo pack so that you are not out of rounds after a short engagement.  22 total rounds goes way to fast, and you are not likely to get more than a few kills with those shots assuming you are getting all head shots.  The sniper rifle felt just as useless to me as I fired round after round into a crowd.  I was getting many hits, but in the end only one kill before I gave that weapon up and never touched it again.

All in all I am not impressed with 2042.  I have refunded my purchase and I don't know if I will look back at the game again.  Thankfully the BF4 servers are still doing well (better currently thanks to a sale) else I would have nothing to fall back on.  Please, EA, stop chasing the cash and listen to your fans.  You had the roadmap in place for a good BF game and you fucked it up in hopes of getting every dollar we have..."
"I really hate the fact the comma rose is gone, something so simple that allowed communication with my team. As well as squad commands. So many little things that made battlefield have an identity were removed. 

 Also I had no idea where the fuck to go to get ammo and health can you still grab ammo from players backs like you could in bfv? 

All things being said I still had a fun times when I was able to squad up with some buddies."
It's not gone. It's confirmed to be in the final game.
"I liked it but it wasn't quite bf. I hope this is just a beta problem.
- The emersion was hard due to everyone looking the same but that can be fixed easily.
- I'm sure specialists are here to stay so they need to do some balancing/adding incentive to play certain characters (medic).
- scoreboard, again not sure if this is a beta thing.
- point system hopefully will be in the full release= more incentive for support players.
- they gotta bring back micless commands and somehow bring focus back on team. Whether it be bringing back the commander mixed with point system or what, I feel this will really make this game okay with a lot of ppl. 
- destruction.... Not sure how this will play out completely. Will it be bf4 style? There is a bunch going on so I can let it slide.
- wish the plus system would switch with the grenade on the controller. 
- movement is fine in my book.
- someone mentioned crouched running. Sad to see that go. 
- hope they have legacy heli controls, plus I wish they were more responsive.
- lastly they gotta utilize the map more. I kept driving through that tunnel like... Fuck man this would be a sweet bottleneck. Or be on this open field like.. shit this would be great if there were some trenches. Maybe it's just orbital but it's just so open.. 
- also to speak to fortifications Maybe add a specialist that can build fortifications later???.

I'm sure I'm forgetting other wishlist things but honestly if they address the commands, points, and teamwork I'll be happy."
What happened to the BFV-like movement DICE said would come to BF 2042?
Probably right next to the body dragging system they repeatedly promised for BFV?
"I really hate the specialist system. Classes and gadgets worked so much better and made more sense in the context of the game.

It’s too early to hate on graphics, and animations etc. but they definitely need some major work.

This game feels no where near completion. And it seems like they’re trying to emulate apex and warzone.

The return to a modern military setting was much needed after 3 games in a row departed from modern war. But it seems like choosing a setting 20 years in the future, was to justify a certain amount of bullshittery.

The atmosphere just isn’t there, it all feels so stripped down.

If it’s included in EA play I’ll give it another shot when it’s fully released, but I’m definitely not spending $60 on this game"
"Was super excited for this once I saw initial release stuff - Played the beta as much as I could and overall let down, here's some of the bigger things.

\- Really enjoyed the plus system but I hope we have menu customization options as well as other options for plus - basically have the ability to have frequently used options in plus vs all attachments. 

\- Map was cool, some of it felt awkward due to scale and location. Felt like some walk/runs took forever if you didn't have a vehicle on hand. 

\- The Ranger ""Robo dog""... Not a huge fan of laying prone sniping on a hillside and being counter sniped by a machine gun wielding dog from 200m away. Tone that down pls and ty.

\- Specialists - I mean I think everyone shares at least a common feeling of disappointment in these but there's been some really good options put out there on how to make these better and bring the BF feel back for the community while allowing EA to collect their transaction income.

\- Adding onto this - I just want the ability to also see what my team and squad is bringing to the fight... Gadgets and such. 

\- Medics somehow need some love too - Healing syringe was kind of wack, revive is awful and there's not much incentive to play it currently it seems.

\- Gun play - Im not sure what it was but something just felt incredibly off with gunplay, Im not a top tier player but in past battlefield games I could definitely hold up on the scoreboard but this game just felt awkward. Maybe since it was just the beta things weren't as smooth. That's fine, Ill try it out again obv.

\- Ammo/Health Cache 

A lot of other little things but these were bigger ones for me and it seems a lot of people shared similar views.

&#x200B;

Hoping they delay this to either make it right or promise some big changes down the road.

Canceled my ultimate edition preorder and im waiting to see what the dev response is before I preorder again. Worst case ill wait a while and just get the normal version once its less buggy.

I really love BF series and I hope they take the extra time to make this a great game for our sake and theirs. This type of community feedback can really help them, just seems a lot of companies lately are out of touch with their communities and are only looking to gain more income via in-game transactions."
Game doesn't feel good to me. I'm not smart enough to know why tho. Maybe it's the speedyfast movement or the netcode idk. BF4 is on Xbox Game Pass for PC so I'll be there to get my battlefield fix
Absolutely dreadful optimisation
"My take: fun, bugs galore and horrible FPS. It’s looking like a post release purchase for me."
We should have an option for a normal russian soldier etc vs only no pats. Also we need to be able to customize our soldiers like ghost recon wildlands. If yall included something like that then yall will seal the dealfor goat customization
Yes you'll be able to customise the soldier. This was just the beta
"I hope Dice looks into this!

On Xbox One X, the Fire Rate of many Assault Rifle is not true Full Automatic. As you held down the Fire Button, The Fire Rate varied randomly, starting at full Auto, then some burst in the middle, more auto and so on. 
This Bug was not every time i played but a few of my Friends had same Issue.
Its very frustrating because it makes recoil control and gunplay in general completely random and broken.
I was really amazed at how stupid this bug was. (and i encountered a lot of them) 
I really hope this gets sorted out until release."
this was also on PC. but I think it might be more netcode related.
"Will 2042 have operation on launch?

Imagine Operation from BF1 with Narrator along with Grand Operation from BF 5 merge.

It would make sense for 2042 since it didnt have campaign.

If we go to Operation Orbital, it will start with narrator narrating the lore of 2042, the USA have to defend the rocket while the Russia take over sector by sector to reach the rocket and destroy it. With the random chance of Tarnados destroying everything.

And the next map is part of Orbital, but I doubt we will get something like grand op from bF5, where the next match, we will start from Osprey parachutting down onto the next map with limited resources taken from previous orbital map, so normal operation from B1 is good too."
"I didn't have anything other than a Xbox One X to play the beta on and I suffered from input latency the entire time. I would advise that no one purchase this game on that console and maybe PS4 as well. There is also no aim assist whatsoever for controllers, which only exacerbates the issue with latency when in gunfights. Me and my opponents would be positioned 10m away from one another and we would just completely empty our magazines trying to hit each other strafing from side to side. 

Hopefully I'll have an upgraded PC in time for the release."
"I played it both on the Series S and Xbox One X. While the Series S version wasn't perfect, it was stable and played pretty well. It was very noticeable that the Xbox One version needs a lot of TLC. 

If the upgraded PC falls through, getting a Series wouldn't be a bad alternative."
I noticed that i can make 2 quick shots or even double shot from any rocket launcher before needing to reload that if i shoot fast enough
"My experience with the beta is mainly that I only have performance issues to complain about as well as the inability to identify players' factions. However, I have more news to share after reading others' experiences on Reddit.

I've seen someone glitch through the menus in order to access Battlefield Portal (no functionality, just UI), and I would like to be signposted to an active and more relevant subreddit in order for me to discuss EA's licensing terms. That and performance issues (if not rectified significantly upon release) are enough for me to consider refunding the game.

I am aware that EA's Positive Play charter (which I take issue to as being more of an egregious anti-piracy or anti-copyright infringement deterrent over an effective code of conduct) has existed for longer than Battlefield 2042's public existence but I did not see much of a reason to criticize it when I did not see a new title from EA worth investing time and money in. I don't think I can agree to my own game modes in particular to being used by EA and then them maybe suing others for imitations (if this would even be possible). I'll detail what exactly pissed me off from this [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/879582099374477342/896913925797449748/RDT_20211011_0111253065449667086519475.jpg):

"Ngl I really like the concept although I think this should be played on current gen or pc, old gen (in my case I played the beta on my ps4) is really not that good. Sometimes you'll find a game with good fps (until the rocket explodes or the hurricane arrives) other times you can literally count the frames... I know they planned it for current gen and they most likely decided to support old gen due to the lack of consoles but I really hope they can polish it up on schedule for launch. One last thing did anyone else got the assist (I think that's it? When instead of the skull you get the little hand) easter egg where after a little bit it would raise the middle finger a little bit? I noticed it while fighting some enemies but then forgot to save the clip to see if I was seeing things or not and now I keep thinking of it..."
But why on ps4 Pre-order it says that the beta starts on 12 October?

"Where are you from bro ? I’m 25 from London I used to feel the same way i got a few people from all over the world , Norway , Iceland , America and London that I met on Battlefield 5 , Theyre bound to all be on when 2042 drops , you’re welcome to join , we’re Console PS5 players though , I still need to get a PS5 - All sold out 👎 , BF Veterans , I’m myself a Sniper but I also love playing infrantry with a sniper or AR , send over your online ID and I’ll invite you sometime"
"Lol everyone in here bitching like cry babies. ""My point and shoot game feels too much like that other game where you point and shoot!"" All of you sounds like bitches."
"you're right, gamers are just entitled, don't buy it if you don't like it I say

&#x200B;

/s"
"Does this game have AI bots and if so, are they any good?"
"I honestly really enjoyed the beta. The gunplay feels great, especially from long distance (I wish suppression against snipers was bigger though). This game truly feels like a battlefield."
Have an option to lock the transport helicopter to squad only. It kinda sucks having a teammate switch seats to repair just to get thier gunner seat stolen.
"I do see alot of people say they liked 2042 (I loved it) but I also see people say its awful ""compared to Battlefield 4"" and honestly.... I dont like 4 that much, its fine, but even 5 is better imo."
How can you not like 4? Sure it wasn’t BF3 or BFBC2 but it was better then BF1 and BFV
"Idk, just didnt like it much. I know others love it, people say its the best, and thats okay! I just personally didnt enjoy it as much as I have BFV."
 absolutely furious I bought BF2042 ultimate edition on the first day I could buy it. (All the way back in September or August whenever it was.)  and I tried to get in the beta over and over. But I wouldn’t load past the Home Screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled. I used a different PC restarted I did everything… so I spent 150 or whatever for nothing apparently. from the looks of it seems like a good game tho. I hope I can play the beta. Oh wait…
"It wasn’t supposed to

There was a separate game called the Beta access version that you had to download besides the one that showed up when you pre ordered"
yeah had everything I needed but it’s whatever now but  still mad tho
Wait so you were loading up the correct program? You downloaded the separate open beta game from origin? I hadn't heard anybody else with this issue
I tried loading both of them multiple times I have no clue what went wrong
Then it was a problem on your end
I believe it was something on my end but I tried a different PC so it might of been my network or something idk how stuff works
Protip: When the beta of a game you preordered doesn't work... That’s probably a sign to cancel the preorder!
Most likely but in the face of battlefield I throw all divine messages the trash.
"Oh, another person I can point out a finger and laugh for preordering a Battlefield game xD

Y'know how Battlefield 3, 4, Hardline, 1, Battlefront 1, Battlefront 2  and V was broken for months after launch? Yeah, maybe its time to take a lesson from the past, buddy."
I want to laugh but I can only cry
these comments are making me think alot of you don't understand what a beta is lmao
"I believe you are not understanding that this is a beta of a game releasing next month. If there are many issues with the game now, I doubt they will fix them in a month"
except they explicitly stated the beta build is months old lmao
"Beta's don't happen 1 month until release.

This is a demo. Nothing more nothing less."
"as i said before, learn what a beta is"
"This literally isn't a beta.

It's a demo."
thanks for the gold!
"Yeah but they arnt going to change the core gameplay at all, even if its beta lol"
gamers big mad about this comment lmao
"I fucking loved this beta, even the specialists, it was exactly what BF needed. All you fucking old raisins that are bitching and whining about how they ruined the game need to chill out. That's why they made portal."
"So you just want the series to be like every other shooter out there instead of being itself. 

Got it."
"That's why theres portal, BF will always be unique"
Yes. Paying $60 for old content. Bravo. So unique.
"Lmao whatev man,  im still gonna play and have more fun in this one than any other battlefield."
"Enjoy it al you want. I got no interest in playing this new call of duty bf junk. It barely resembles a BF game anymore. Plays exactly like ground war from 2019. 

I was hoping it would bring me back but it’s even more arcady and brain dead than it’s ever been. I’ll stick with 2/4/1 and squad."

I don’t want to say people bad in video games but I can agree with you. This game have a big difference from previous parts. I can compare like it was with bf2 and bf3. It is really cool that battlefield gonna change but still have it own style
"Yeah battlefield bc 2, battlefield 3 were my favorite of all time. This feels like it stems off of those. I am excited for it"
"I was bitching about everything at first but I like I got some sleep and now I like it. Core gameplay is top notch. I also know the playtest we just experienced is a several months old and IS essentially an alpha, that’s straight from dice. However, they NEED to add aim assist for controller players. I want cross play but had to disable it and rework my settings to get used to that. But that only works for the M5. I couldn’t use other guns because of this. It’ll take some getting used to. But I’m keeping my preorder"
"i got level 30, so i really like the fundamentals, but i think the most important priority should be for the devs to have faction based operator looks.
It feels like such an lazy job from dice fighting the same chars on the other team. Oh and also jets are useless, attack heli Op as hell.
I also think if this build was really this old they should iron out most of these bugs and performance issues until release. All in all i am really excited to see the full game, all the vehicles, weapons, customization options for them - and most important all the other maps. 
Because i cant stand Orbital anymore. lol"
"In my opinion, it's mainly going to come down to the quality of the rest of the maps. Gunplay was solid and fun. The specialist system has a lot of flaws but nothing that can't be fixed. I see a lot of potential. I'm probably going to buy it a year after release depending on how popular it stays."
"It's a poorly balanced, buggy, laggy, mess, missing dozens of features from battlefields recent past that improved the game ([https://youtu.be/lJPzl8U5UDc](https://youtu.be/lJPzl8U5UDc)).

The build may be three months old but I don't see how radical they can change it, the game needs to be delayed so the developers can release a product worthy of the franchise, and capable of surviving for more than a month in the current market.

I really wanted BF2042 to be amazing but it seems like DICE/EA completely failed to understand where they went wrong with BFV, and their solution was to grab some features from Apex & Warzone and shoved them into the game.

Disappointed doesn't begin to cover it."
"So after playing 2042 and thinking about why it isn't clicking for me, I've come to the conclusion that I just find it boring. The engagements in the game just aren't fun. I'm not big on the game having operators, very limiting feature for a game that's trying to give the player more options. The attachment system is kinda neat but really only matters at the start of the match, other than that you might change from an acog to a red dot about midway through a match. Helicopters and the lack of options to take care of them suck. There might be more options in the base game but I can only go off the beta. Ultimately, I've found no reason to play it over 4 or V. I definitely found no reason to buy it before 9-12 months of it's lifespan has passed, I get it at less than half off with all the content and bug fixes. It'll be thoroughly beta tested from all the launch players by then."
"Thoroughly enjoyed the beta, don't really understand what people are complaining about. Specialists aren't as bad as I thought, teamwork was absolutely still there... Yes it was repetitive but that's what you get with a single map...

Vehicles are great fun, I feel like I can actually use them this time round, unlike bf4 where I was a shitter. Graphics look fine, could do with a bit of refinement imo but they're not crap .

Gunplay and gameplay were absolutely fantastic, feels like a battlefield should, especially on that VAB, felt like siege of Shanghai in steroids!"
I had a blast!  Can’t wait for release
"Not for me. There's many things I didn't like about BF 2042, which has been mentioned by others repeatedly.

I purchased from Steam, so I was able to get a seamless refund. (Steam has no limitations on PreOrder Refunds).

Coincidentally, BF 4, BF1, BF 5 combination bundle is on sale for about $10 bucks, so I'd be getting that instead!"
"Solid choice! Now THAT is a solid bundle that I’d gladly pay 60$ for if I didn’t have the games already.

The campaigns alone are worth well over 10$!

(Especially IV and BF1. The campaigns in BFV is kinda meh.)"
"I liked it. 

I thought it was fun despite the bugs."
I think DICE made a battle royale game and put the BF name on it.
"Is there anyway to repair vehicles like the previous games? Or that gone?

Is it a bug that when you kill the driver of a vehicle they launch out of it into the sky?"
There's a repair tool
Yes but you have to exit vehicle and repair tool takes up your gadget slot
You mean the aka rocket launcher slot?
Yes or as I can it aka med kit slot
"I had a lot of fun during my time on the beta. From what i understand this was a 3 month old build we were playing so I'm really hoping in that time they fixed some issues and bugs.

Had some stuttering and frame issues on PS5 as well.

My biggest complain is how ugly the HUD was and how any notification that popped up took so much screen space."
"Tried the beta on PS4 and it was terrible - first game ended pretty much as soon as I joined, though I did get to go a heli wing with a side gun...peppering a rooftop only for nothing to land at all, despite aiming right at several of them. 

In the 2nd game, after running (or rather, skating, in a weird, bobbing, floaty motion) miles and miles just to see / encounter someone, I'd hit fire, the gun looked like it was spitting, it was on target, but there seemed to be a 0.5 second delay and nothing landing / no sound. 

Then whoever I was shooting at, unharmed, would turn around and insta kill me. This happened time and again. So, I turned it off and deleted it. Gunplay felt utterly broken. 

The map is too sparse and large too, and sometimes I'd run past a hangar door and the inside was just all black. Discerning friend from foes was almost impossible."
"I really hope they add a 2nd Gadget slot. It would lift up class fantasy so much more even with operators. Together it would be perfect imo.

You could limit it to certain combinations, or have 1 Operator with the special ability to have 2 gadgets."
"I hope not.  The game is already leaning towards making people a ""one man army"" instead of a teammate fulfilling a role.   Giving even more gadgets would be worse than ever"
I couldn’t play once because I couldn’t get past the title screen and have audio on my Bluetooth headset……. Cool.
