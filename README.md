This is the repo for the Data & Social Media Analysis final project
Now I'm testing a pull request
data should include:
  1. "Battlefield_submissions.csv" This file containts data for me to reference to submissions
  2. "text.csv" This file containts the actual text of the submissions
Now I'm testing out the pull function
